When I look back over the best memories that managed to stick in my old brain most involve having fit fun with  family and close friends. Here are a few:

- Chasing my dad down back side of Murphy's Hogback on Moab White Rim trail
- Sea kayaking on the Carolina coast with my young wife and kids
- Rocking to Zeppelin at 5am headed to the ski slopes with my high-school buddies
- Racing crits with a small audience of my closest friends who just loved the vibe
- Running the Timpanogos half-marathon with my sister and her husband

I never really had as much fun when I was paid for it.

I've done plenty of events and activities that felt flat because I didn't have family and friends with me to enjoy them together.

Never cared to torture my spectators with long events that have nothing for them to do but sit and wait for 4-8 hours.
