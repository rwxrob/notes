When I look back over the best memories that managed to stick in my old brain most involve having fit fun with  family and close friends. Here are a few:

- Chasing my dad down back side of Murphy's Hogback on Moab White Rim trail
- Sea kayaking on the Carolina coast with my young wife and kids
- Rocking to Zeppelin at 5am headed to the ski slopes with my high-school buddies
- Racing crits with a small audience of my closest friends who just loved the vibe
- Running the Timpanogos half-marathon with my sister and her husband

I never really had as much fun when I was paid for it. Being a river guide was fun, but not nearly as fun as doing the same thing with my closest friends. In fact, I never really became super close friends with the other guides who has been doing it a while. Same for guiding on the White Rim trail. I did it several times with my dad but all the times I was paid to guide for someone else it was just artificial and flat even though I did my best always to make everyone feel like they had a friend.

I've done plenty of events and activities that felt flat because I didn't have family and friends with me to enjoy them together. My first full marathon, Thunder-road, I did entirely by myself. I was alone in a sea of people and could barely drive myself home afterward. I can't count how many 5-10k runs I have done where 

Never cared to torture my spectators with long events that have nothing for them to do but sit and wait for 4-8 hours.
