I never ride on substantial gravel with this bike. For the most part the gravel is connecting low-traffic roads. I do enjoy slowing down on the trails and bridges that usually have a lot of slippery stuff on them so the 38s cover that. I'm *never* seeking a peloton to ride with but if one comes by I will sometimes ride with them for a while. I prefer that to any group ride on stupid routes that never take into consideration traffic safety.
