I never ride on substantial gravel with this bike. For the most part any gravel is connecting low-traffic roads.

I do enjoy slowing down the pace and taking trails and bridges that usually have a lot of slippery stuff on them so the 38s cover that. Summers in NC have a lot of rain storms so these tires cover that.

I *never* seek a peloton but if one comes by I will sometimes join them for a while. It's not that I cannot hang with them, it's more about the vibe and experience of peloton riding on high-traffic roads that these guys insist on keeping on their "regular" route.  Plus a peloton normally won't go on a slow, windy, scenic tail with people and dogs and frogs and deer.
