I always do better with a goal. I've had cycling goals for most of my life and it has done a lot to keep me motivated. My goal has always been to be a podium finisher in my age group. These days the only difference is I don't care much about any competition that isn't eSports bike racing which I can do for the rest of my life. More than half the esports competitors I race against are over the age of 50—and a significant number are over 70! This is a fitness goal I can hold onto forever.

## 4.0 W/kg

To pull off consistent wins against an international field of eSports competitors I'm going to need to reach 4.0 W/kg. I know that sounds like a lot—especially for an old guy like me—but I want to dream big here.

## Sprinter focus

I don't have the physical dimensions to be a classics all-rounder and I don't want to go all the way to climber-level weight loss which leaves me in the sprinter category.

I definitely have the mental attitude and genetics for sprinting and a very high threshold for pain. It's what made me a decent triathlete (although, let's be honest, at 174 cm I'm far too short for competitive triathletes). I've been complimented (without solicitation) for my sprinting on Zwift rides before. 

Zwift makes sprinting so incredibly fun, no danger, just power, plus you get immediate recognition in several different ways even if you are not in an actual race.

IRL sprinting is also a good category for someone with a heavier IRL bike like my top-of-the-entry-level Trek Domane AL 5 Gen 4.

Sprinting also pairs well with mountain bike roller-coaster riding, which I absolutely love.

## Weight: 67

To have any chance of hitting 4.0 W/kg I have to get my weight down to 67 kilos (from 85 currently). I managed to get to 77 last year and then completely blew it. At 0.25 kilos per week loss that will take 1.5 years. I think anything more than that is far too aggressive to still enjoy life. I'm not in a huge hurry—although I would like to *not* be in the "overweight" BMI category by May.

The biggest lifestyle change is just eating more plant-based foods that are nutrient dense and have low caloric density.

The easiest way to achieve this is just reduce the fat and meat in my diet. A little healthy fat is always required for balance and to feel full, just don't go crazy, Rob.

Most importantly this means zero alcohol which second only to fat in caloric density. At least a little fat makes you feel full for the cost in calories, alcohol does not. Hell, even an entire package of Swedish Fish is better for me than a single IPA. If I want a buzz I can find other ways, like endorphins and dopamine
## FTP: 270

Honestly, I would *love* to hit 300 but 270 is a very high goal. I didn't really have a sense of what a good FTP was last year but the more I have been following other competitors and watching my own FTP I realize this is an attainable but aggressive goal. I hit 241 in 2024 and I'm pretty sure if Summer had not derailed my training entirely I could have pushed it up higher.

## Prioritize sleep

The secret to all of this is mostly sleep. Sleep allows me to do two training sessions per day and fully recover. Sneaking an extra two hour nap in the middle of day and still hitting the training hours and work requirements means that there really isn't much time for anything else—especially live streaming stupid tech stuff. The answer is now obvious when the decision comes, "Should I livestream random tech stuff or take a nap?" Naps just make me so freaking happy. Maybe it's an old guy thing.
## Consistency is key

As with any training, I have to remember that it is the marginal daily gains that matter. I love that Strava fitness points are based on this. The longer and less intense and more frequent sessions built up huge fitness points over ultra long rides every once in a while or the short and hard stuff infrequently.
