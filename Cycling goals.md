I always do better with a goal. I've had cycling goals for most of my life and it has done a lot to keep me motivated. My goal has always been to be a podium finisher in my age group. These days the only difference is I don't care much about any competition that isn't eSports bike racing which I can do for the rest of my life. More than half the esports competitors I race against are over the age of 50—and a significant number are over 70! These bad-ass seniors remind me there's absolutely no excuse not to go for it. This is a fitness goal I can hold onto forever and really enjoy. Who gives a shit if 95% of the rest of the people my age have given up. Not me (and not Doris).

## 4.0 W/kg

To pull off consistent wins against an international field of eSports competitors I'm going to need to reach 4.0 W/kg. I know that sounds like a lot—especially for an old guy like me—but I want to dream big here.

## Sprinter focus

At 174 cm (Mark Cavendish is 175) and with my tendency to put on muscle easily—especially in my legs, and with my shorter leg length (which I got from my dad) I believe I have the best chance at building a sprinter body. Sprinters don't go under 72 kg usually meaning it will be easier to maintain. Sprinters also keep around the most muscle over time so it is good to fight off sarcopenia as I age, "build a booty" as my Yoga instructor used to say if you want to have a high-quality senior life. 

I also have a very high threshold for pain. It's what made me a decent triathlete (although, let's be honest, at 174 cm I'm far too short for competitive triathletes). 

Sprinting also pairs well with the short punchy climbs on my Goblin route that almost double as sprinter strength training sessions when I hit them really hard so I don't necessarily have to go to the gym or do any kind of strength training (although I probably will).

Zwift makes sprinting so incredibly fun, no danger, just power, plus you get immediate recognition in several different ways even if you are not in an actual race. I've actually been complimented (without solicitation) for my sprinting on Zwift rides before and sprinting is something I can do all year long.

IRL sprinting is also a good category for someone with a heavier IRL bike like my top-of-the-entry-level Trek Domane AL 5 Gen 4.

Sprinting also pairs well with mountain bike roller-coaster riding, which I absolutely love.

## Weight: 70

To have any chance of hitting 4.0 W/kg I have to get my weight down to 70 kilos. This is the weight Mark Cavendish maintained for his 30 TdF stage wins over his career and he's 175cm.

I managed to get to 77 last year and then completely blew it. At 0.25 kilos per week loss that will take 1.5 years. I think anything more than that is far too aggressive to still enjoy life—especially at my age. I'm not in a huge hurry—although I would like to *not* be in the "overweight" BMI category by May. What I absolutely _don't_ want to do is blow my muscle mass and fitness by not eating enough (like Tadaj Podachar).

The biggest lifestyle change is just eating more plant-based foods that are nutrient dense and have low caloric density. One big reminder I've had recently is that even easily digestible complex carbs like those in white rice and—my favorite—plain waffles are far less dense in calories than fat, alcohol, meat, and simple carbs. Same is true of red and green lentils.

If I just reduce the fat and meat in my diet and keep the same training volume without holding any carbs back I will hit this goal. A little healthy fat is always required for balance and to feel full, just don't go crazy, Rob.

Most importantly this means zero alcohol which is second only to fat in caloric density and does nothing but poison your body. Every single time I've gained weight it was because of alcohol—the worse being wine and liquor that contain sugar and alcohol. At least a little fat makes you feel full for the cost in calories, alcohol does not. Hell, even an entire package of Swedish Fish is better for me than a single IPA. If I want a buzz I can find other ways, like endorphins and dopamine which I've always preferred anyway. In fact, I've found that by substituting a black coffee and burrito or muffin instead of an IPA that I enjoy it more and feel better. Even an occasional Coca Cola is better than *anything* with alcohol—especially while out on a ride. I do wonder what a TCH gummy would be like, however.
## FTP: 270

Honestly, I would *love* to hit 300 but 270 is a very high goal. I didn't really have a sense of what a good FTP was last year but the more I have been following other competitors and watching my own FTP I realize this is an attainable but aggressive goal. I hit 241 in 2024 and I'm pretty sure if Summer had not derailed my training entirely I could have pushed it up higher.

## Prioritize sleep

The secret to all of this is mostly sleep. Sleep allows me to do two training sessions per day and fully recover. Sneaking an extra two hour nap in the middle of day and still hitting the training hours and work requirements means that there really isn't much time for anything else—especially live streaming stupid tech stuff. The answer is now obvious when the decision comes, "Should I livestream random tech stuff or take a nap?" Naps just make me so freaking happy. Maybe it's an old guy thing.
## Consistency is key

As with any training, I have to remember that it is the marginal daily gains that matter. I love that Strava fitness points are based on this. The longer and less intense and more frequent sessions built up huge fitness points over ultra long rides every once in a while or the short and hard stuff infrequently.
