Some of the best cyclists in the world who spend the more hours in the saddle than any humans on Earth actually unstitch the chamois pad and remove it from their shorts. Eventually, they get the right saddle for them and their rear adapts to it. Perhaps this is why I liked my NeoPros so much. The pad is absolutely minimal compared to the Amazon monstrosities I bought a few years back In fact, the bibs with the bigger pad are *more* likely to make my but go numb and cause discomfort than the thinner ones, as counter intuitive as that is.
