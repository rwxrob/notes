Unless you are guaranteed to be in an area with very strong signal Moblin just won't work because the main limitation is the total amount of wireless providers that can be bonded. Moblin _does not allow bonding multiple service providers_ the way that a Belabox does.

What's worse is that Moblin _requires_ RTMP mode usage of cameras which already has well-known limitations the worst of which is electronic interference. The webcam mode of DJI cameras with stabilization is still king.

It is true that you can bond multiple ethernet connections but to do that you need a hardware router and USB ethernet adapters for the phones that prevent them from charging. At that point you might as well just use a Belabox. There is no phone USB ethernet adapter that also provides power to the phone.
