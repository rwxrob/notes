Rene Herse Barlow Pass 38c Endurance is my new standard tire. They are not cheap at $200 a pair but they are absolutely perfect for all riding I ever want to do at this point. They are definitely fast enough to keep up with everyone on the less-frequent group rides and gran fondos but are robust enough to last for 1000s of miles crossing the country when the time time comes.
