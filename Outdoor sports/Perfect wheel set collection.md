I've managed to get my perfect, preferred collection of wheel sets turning my humble endurance bike into as much of a specialized bike that I need depending on events and conditions:

- Swiss Side Hadron2 Ultimate Aero + Conti 26/28c (race, aero)
- Stock Bontrager Paradigm SL + Bontrager R2 Hard-Case Lite 32c (winter training)
- Swiss Side Pion2 Aluminum  + Maxxis Rambler 38c (light gravel)
