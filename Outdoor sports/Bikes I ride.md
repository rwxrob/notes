I ride mostly for the vibes and fitness but I'm also pretty damn competitive. When I race it is mostly against myself with an occasional group dynamic. For all-out crit racing and race-craft I'm on the indoor bike.  The most competitive racing I do outside is anything I can do on my Domane without swapping anything but wheels (usually endurance based gran fondos, super light gravel racing, supported groups). I generally avoid spicy regular group rides.

## Dom

The Domane (all-road) is my main bike and has three wheel sets:

1. Swiss-side 26/28c, 63mm deep aero, tubeless (most of the year)
2. Stock bontrager, 32c, tubeless (winter, slam them up)
3. Maxxis rambler 40/38c, tubeless (light gravel)

Turns out Dom can do every [annual outdoor event](Annual%20outdoor%20events.md) I ever want to do because I don't need more tire than a 42c in front and *never* plan on riding in any event that has a lot of mud of any kind. I have no intention of doing Unbound, Mid-South, like, ever. I might do Steam Boat or BWR
## Keshy

My Salsa Marrakesh ("Keshy") is a tank designed for ultra-stable, long-distance, longevity. She doesn't go anywhere (but downhill) fast, but the places she *can* go with the stuff she can carry make it worth it. For example, while it might take forever to climb a canyon when I do get to the top I can put on my parka or hop into my huge cozy sleeping bag and tent to have a great time out in Fall, Spring, and even Winter. Keshy has two quick-release wheel sets that are also tanks in terms of never breaking spokes under load:

1. 38 Renee Herse slicks, tubeless (roads)
2. Vittoria Mescal 2.1, tubeless (everything else)
