Realizing I'm [addicted to cruising speed](Addicted%20to%20cruising%20speed.md) has helped explain why bike touring did not work out for me. The bike part of bike touring sucks. I mean it _really_ sucks. And let's be honest, the touring part is America is really bad. I don't want to tour the traffic of every different American small town with its dogs and trucks and idiots.

The entire time I tried long hauling all I could think about was how fast I could go on given section of road if I didn't have all that weight or dared to send it on the descents. Sometimes I'd think how trapped I was on that big, lumbering behemoth. There was absolutely no getting myself out of trouble with that, no "picking lines" through urban traffic. I crave the enjoyment of riding a bike that actually moves like a bike and not having that really bothered me. I am so much happier now that the most I'll carry with me is basically just a wind breaker. It means support and logistics of my preferred rides is completely different but I'm willing to make that change to maintain the experience of the riding itself.
