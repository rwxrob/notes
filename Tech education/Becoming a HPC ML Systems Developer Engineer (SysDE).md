Here's the stuff I suggest to become a modern SysDE.

- [Grok what a Systems Developer Engineer does?](What%20is%20a%20Systems%20Developer%20Engineer?.md)
- Master "just in time learning" to keep up with the pace of tech innovation
- Learn to read and write the critical, related languages:
	- POSIX shell
	- bash
	- Python 3
	- Go (including Go template language)
	- SQL
	- JSON/YAML
	- GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)
	- Read C (enough to understand Linux/Unix system calls)
- Apply AI to everything
	- Implement Model Context Protocol to expose APIs and documentation to LLMs
