***Why do I need a home lab?***

Keep up with stuff from work and vibe coding.

***What do I need to practice for work?***

- Coding in Go, bash (even though I do POSIX at home), Perl, Python
- ML job submission API with endpoints
- Kubernetes setup with Kubespray and GPU enabled nodes
- Practice MIG-enabled k8s nodes
- k8sapp specification
- Ansible in general
- Machine learning job submission to Kubernetes applications

***Does it need to be running all the time?***

No. Just to try out new things. If and when I need a server I will use a cloud provider like one of the following:

- Digital Ocean
- Contabo
- Hetzner
- GCP

I no longer recommend people use my server to learn Linux. Instead, I encourage them to use a cheap Linux machine or a cloud provider.
