As I do final prep and research for The Cheaha challenge, the only GFNat "partner" event I'm doing, I see that it includes the overall start-to-finish time in the calculation of final GFNAT points. In fact, there is only a single timed segment (3-mile climb) on the whole 84 mile route for my age group that I'm forced to do instead of the 100. That just sucks. This defeats the main attraction of the GFNat series in the first place. The entire point of timed-segment events is to promote casual fun at the rest stops and camaraderie while allowing serious competition during the timed segmentsâ€”especially when "packs" are prohibited.  
  
There are also several other reasons I won't be doing Cheaha ever again:  
  
- Forcing 55-59 UCI to do the Medio instead of the Gran  
- Serious descents for miles on roads sharing regular tourist traffic  
- Slow climbers and 6% grade descenders on *the same open roads*  
- Prohibited "packs" during ride because open roads  
- History of serious accidents  
- Sink hole in road took out most of Ultra route in 2025  
- Absolutely horrible road quality for an event of this size  
- No jersey included in $200 entry fee  
- Absolutely stupid jersey designs  
- I just really, really hate Alabama  
- Detours to allow "construction of hotel" in a State Park  
  
Just watch this video to see what I mean: slash BMckMaR44sM. As you can see from that video there are a number of extremely close calls with oncoming traffic and idiots crossing the center line to get an advantage. It goes without saying that none of these riders were disqualified or even penalized for blatantly putting everyone in danger when they swerved back into the lane just in time to avoid oncoming head-on collisions. This is *exactly* why I got out of road racing. It's also the reason I refused to do the Assault on Mt. Mitchell after registering and reconning the route and hearing about the near fatal dog incident. These organized events are suppose to make us *safer* not put us into more danger. Apparently, only the official events done by GFNat qualify as this level of professional. Whistler as well when they close down *the entire highway* for that event. I have no patience for anything less.  
  
So for me Cheaha will be a training group ride with a big hill in it. That's all. The bogus segment + total time points combined with lack of any rules enforcement for cheaters crossing the center line on descents is enough to negate the validity of any results at all, to me. They mean nothing. People cheat in all sorts of ways constantly in this sport and it has always pissed me off. I refuse to be counted among them.
