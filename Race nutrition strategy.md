- I've decided to only use 550 bottles to practice for group rides and competition and just top them off with water.
- After studying Chris Miller's strategy the first two bottles will have electrolyte and carb and the refills will just be water to keep things simple. 
- Carbs then later come from 1 or two "sugar flasks" with my a homemade gel (multiple carbs + electrolytes, etc.) in them so that water can vary depending on the heat for the day.
- If I've pre-fueled properly and dialed in my fat-burning system and start relatively slowly that should mean that the 2.5-3 hours are covered by the bottles and a smaller 150ml flask (assuming I get about 1g of carb per ml of gel). 
- The second 2.5-3 hours are covered entirely by the 250ml second flask, no dependency on random refueling stock.
- The 250g of added weight for my own flask are easily made up in time savings refueling in seconds instead of minutes. 
- This assumes a 300 FTP so no more than 100g carbs per hour is actually burned. I'll likely never need to go over and if so will add solid food.
- Taking one no-doze (200mg caffeine) at hour 2.5 and optionally another at hour 3.5 (never more since 400mg is max).

## Training ride plan to train gut

- Pre-fuel on waffles and/or rice (120g) 2-3 hours before
- Work from 40g to 60g of carbs in each 550ml bottle
- Additional 10g per week
