## 🎛️ NVIDIA Device Plugin vs GPU Operator

| Feature                            | NVIDIA Device Plugin           | NVIDIA GPU Operator             |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                        | Expose GPUs to Kubernetes      | Fully manage GPU stack on nodes |
| **Manages drivers?**              | ❌ No                           | ✅ Yes                          |
| **Deploys container toolkit?**    | ❌ No                           | ✅ Yes                          |
| **Installs DCGM monitoring stack?**| ❌ No                           | ✅ Yes                          |
| **Installs the device plugin?**   | ✅ Yes                          | ✅ Yes (bundled)               |
| **Best for...**                   | Environments with preinstalled drivers | End-to-end GPU automation |
| **Lightweight?**                  | ✅ Very                        | ❌ Heavier, more complete       |

### 🧠 In Detail

#### 🔹 NVIDIA Device Plugin
- A **DaemonSet** that registers GPUs with the kubelet
- Enables `nvidia.com/gpu` resource limits
- Assumes:
  - Drivers are preinstalled
  - NVIDIA container runtime is configured

#### 🔸 NVIDIA GPU Operator
- Full Kubernetes Operator that manages:
  - Drivers
  - Container runtime
  - Device plugin
  - Monitoring (DCGM)
  - MIG configuration
- Ideal for **production** or **automated environments**

### 🛠 Use Case Summary

| Situation                                | Use Which?         |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Bare-metal with drivers already installed| **Device Plugin**   |
| Want fully managed GPU stack via CRDs    | **GPU Operator**    |
| Cloud node pools with GPU (GKE, EKS, etc)| Likely Operator (or both) |
