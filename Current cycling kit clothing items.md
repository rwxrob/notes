Here's my current preferred cycling kit for all my cycling, head to toe. I prefer a gravel-meets-urban style so I look reasonably normal on or off the bike. The main criteria can be summarized into, "What do I need for NC Mountains to Coast?" This gear covers every weather condition in which I'm willing to ride including the following:

- Torrential, sudden downpours, afternoon NC thunderstorms (usually warm)
- 4 C (40 F) low
- 36 C (98 F) high

Any weather situation beyond this is something I just won't ride. The amount of effort to stay alive, let alone actually enjoy the ride, beyond these extremes is just not work the effort. I'll just hop on the indoor trainer instead (or bail if on a group or organized ride). Any ride organizer would definitely agree.

> There's no Spandex or Lycra kit here. I do have it (mostly NeoPro and even a bit of Le Col that I just cannot part with) but I only want to dress like a 50s super hero when going Strava KOM hunting when I'm in peak cycling shape. Too many MAMILs out there that should never wear it. Here's a free tip: lose 10 kilos *before* "getting aero" and you'll get faster. You look ridiculous.

## Head

Getting headwear right is crucial. Temperature regulation really works through the scalp and mine is bald. Too hot of a head and everything else sweats through. Too cold and my hands and feet freeze, which reminds me of the old "if you want warm feet put on a hat adage from skiing days."

- VIictgoal waterproof helmet cover (fits over cap brim as well)
- Giro Aries Spherical Helmet
- MAAP Evade 5 Panel Cap (under helmet, warmer)
- Tillak Wallowa Trail Mesh 5 Panel Cap (under helmet, cooler)
- Trimmed neck gator over ears
- Anbow silicon ear plugs trimmed to not stick out
- Finestic disposable face mask(s)
- Bandanna and/or neck gator
- Prescription glasses with anti-glare and photo-chromatic lenses (AmericasBest)

I have found that combining a good 5-panel hat under a good, general road helmet is always the best for my style of riding (and Dustin Klein agrees). It shields the run and foliage way better than a dedicated MTB helmet, others a layer of moisture wicking and comfort, and looks completely normal when I remove the helmet and leave it with the bike while I grab a coffee or whatever. MAAP makes the Evade, an absolutely perfect version of this cap designed for this purpose but I mix them up for variety and just wear one of DKLEIN's SCRAM or other caps as well under if I know I'm going to be walking around a lot without a helmet.

I once tried a full-face helmet for MTB riding, but that was a waste. I just changed my style of riding to be fine with my "gravel" helmet setup.

The waterproof helmet cover is a super simple and light solution to torrential thunderstorm downpours. It keeps the sometimes cotton hat from completely soaking through and making it impossible to see because of all the water dripping in my eyes.
## Torso

- Gorewear Spinshift Gortex Men's Jacket (M)
- Gorewear Fernflow hooded windbreaker (M)
- Patagonia Nano-Air puffy jacket (not hoody)
- Hurley cotton/poly flannel long-sleeve shirt (10-14C)
- Club Ride Go Long western long-sleeve (14C)
- Merino.tech merino wool tee(s)
- Zengjo light-weight tech tee(s)
- Basic light arm warmers
- NeoPro or YKYWBIKE sleeveless quick-dry undershirt(s)
- Garmin heart rate monitor
- USWE Outlander Pro 2 pack with NDM 1 Action Camera harness

The pack with the camera gear in provides a lot of core warmth since it covers most of my chest and upper back. I can usually get away with a t-shirt under it with arm warmers or just a synthetic flannel gravel shirt. For information on the livestreaming kit see other notes.
