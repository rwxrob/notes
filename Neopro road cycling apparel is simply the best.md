Just did my first indoor ride with a new kit I paid $200 for that would have cost 2-3 times more if I bought Le Col or some other overpriced shit. I cannot overstate how amazing these clothes are for road cycling—especially trying the wicking undershirt with a jersey and to take the edge off the bib straps:

* NeoPro White Undershirt (will change to black later) ($35)
* NeoPro Socks - Black ($10)
* NeoPro Vanta Jersey ($45)
