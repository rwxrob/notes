I work from homeâ€”literally from my bed most of the time. If I don't get up and go outside I would get zero activity for the day. So for me _at least_ three hours a day of physical activity is _essential_. In fact, I should probably do more if I really want to hit the minimums that any human being requires for activity to not entropy to death. Instead, I just make sure to keep my three hours at an intensity that maxes out what I can recover from within 24 hours.
