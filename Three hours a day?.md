I work from homeâ€”literally from my bed most of the time. If I don't get up and go outside I would get zero activity for the day. So for me _at least_ three hours a day of physical activity is _essential_. In fact, I should probably do more if I really want to hit the minimums that any human being requires for activity to not entropy to death. Instead, I just make sure to keep my three hours at an intensity that maxes out what I can recover from within 24 hours.

Case you haven't done the math, that's 21 hours per week. That's a pro level of volume by most standards. But here's the thing, I am not a pro. I am, however, a tech sloth. So subtracting, say, one hour per day just to maintain minimum human function of my body that would put my "training" hours someplace in the 14 hours per week range, about the same as any other weekend warrior wanting to keep up with a curated group of fast friends.
