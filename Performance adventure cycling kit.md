Here are my ongoing notes to develop a high-performance adventure cycling kit that can be used in October in North Carolina. This kit doesn't have a "casual clothes" option because all the clothes double as casual and performance, no lycra at all. Bibs make zero sense because the are hard to get out of, look weird, and only provide minimal aero gains over OrNot Mission shorts in reality.

## Bags

- TailFin Aeropack  (carbon, no fast dropouts, no pannier mounts, $385)
- LeadOut bento box

## Water

The one thing I never want to be caught without is water. (I've had that happen before.) Carrying a filter no matter where I go is _always_ worth it. The 500ml bottles are just

- Katadyn BeFree Tactical 1.0L Water Filter
- 500ml Elite x2 (or 750 depending on trip)





- ClubRide Go-Long shirt x2
- OrNot Mission shorts x2
- ExOfficio underwear (cycling length) x2
- MAAP Evade hat
- MAAP Alt_Road Legionaries  hat (removable sun shield)
- ClubRide ear cover hat
- Patagonia Nano-Air vest
- Merino neck gator, head wrap
- Merino socks x2
- Gorewear Fernflow windbreaker
- Patagonia Dirt Roamer storm pants (rain)
- Patagonia Super Alpine jacket (rain)

## Sleep kit

- Mountain Hardware down pants
- Patagonia Jackon Glacier down parka OR Patagonia Nano-Air hoody
- Down booties ???
- Big Agnes tent (actually water proof)
- Inflatable pad ???
- Inflatable pillow
- Sleeping bag liner




- Coffee kit
- Universal tool
- Universal bike tool
- Minipump
