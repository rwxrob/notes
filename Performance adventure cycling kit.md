Here are my ongoing notes to develop a high-performance adventure cycling kit that can be used in October in North Carolina

- TailFin Aeropack  (carbon, no fast dropouts, no pannier mounts, $385)
- ClubRide Go-Long shirt
- OrNot Mission shorts
- Patagonia Nano-Air vest
- Merino neck gator, head wrap
- Gorewear Fernflow windbreaker
- Patagonia Dirt Roamer storm pants
- Mountain Hardware Down pants


## No bibs

Too hard to use the restroom and stuff plus need to carry overshorts when walking around. Why not just not bring them and use the overshorts alone instead.
