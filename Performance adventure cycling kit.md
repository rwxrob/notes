Here are my ongoing notes to develop a high-performance adventure cycling kit that can be used in October in North Carolina (when NC Mountains to Coast happens). 
## Bags

- TailFin Aeropack  (carbon, no fast dropouts, no pannier mounts, $385)
- LeadOut bento box
## Water

- Katadyn BeFree Tactical 1.0L Water Filter
- 500ml Elite x2 (or 750 depending on trip)

I'm never going on any trip where there isn't reliable water resupply. Sill, the one thing I never want to be caught without is water, even if a I know a resupply is only an hour away (I've had that happen before.) So carrying a filter my fastpacking bag is the default, always.

The 500ml bottles are just easier to get in and out and more likely to encourage me to use them instead of waiting. Plus I'm always carrying less extra water wait when water resupply is relatively reliable.

## Clothing

- ClubRide Go-Long shirt x2
- OrNot Mission shorts x2
- ExOfficio underwear (cycling length) x2
- MAAP Evade hat
- MAAP Alt_Road Legionaries  hat (removable sun shield)
- ClubRide ear cover hat
- Patagonia Nano-Air vest
- Merino neck gator, head wrap
- Merino socks x2
- Zero sandals
- Specialized Torch 3 road shoes
- Gorewear Fernflow windbreaker
- Patagonia Dirt Roamer storm pants (rain)
- Patagonia Super Alpine jacket (rain)

This kit doesn't have a "casual clothes" option because all the clothes double as casual and performance, no lycra at all. Bibs make zero sense because they are hard to get out of, look weird, and only provide minimal aero gains over OrNot Mission shorts in reality.

> [!TIP]
> I love that road pedals are completely rideable with sandals. Wanna be footloose on a hot day and just relax? Perhaps tan those ultra white roadie feet? Put on the sandals. It's okay. It's an advantage that very few performance adventure cyclists consider. You just cannot do the same with SPD pedals (unless you get those heavy double-sided ones).

## Sleep kit

- Mountain Hardware down pants
- Patagonia Jackon Glacier down parka OR Patagonia Nano-Air hoody
- Down booties ???
- Big Agnes tent (actually water proof)
- Inflatable pad ???
- Inflatable pillow
- Sleeping bag liner




- Coffee kit
- Universal tool
- Universal bike tool
- Minipump
