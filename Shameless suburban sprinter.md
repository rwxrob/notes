There's a style of bike riding that most people who love to ride well into their adult years tend to downplay: sprinting on quiet suburban roads. Before I ever raced my first crit I was racing them around the house and then the block and eventually on the way to my girlfriends house ten miles away. Now that I'm considerably older I find myself realizing that is still my favorite way to ride a bike. It makes me wonder how much we allow ourselves to be influenced by others about what we actually enjoy.
