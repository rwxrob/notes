Here are some ideas about the type of bike rider I want to find and befriend. 

- Waves at everyone including car drivers
- Stops at red lights unless it would inconvenience the other drivers
- Never does anything to provoke anyone willingly
- Smiles and ignores drivers yelling at them
- Always says hello and goodbye to other riders
- Slows down to chat a bit when passing *anyone* (even when "training")
- Attends Critical Mass religiously no matter what the weather
- Bikes to Critical Mass (instead of driving to it) from miles away if necessary
- Enters 24 Hours of Booty with other bike friends
- Averages 20+ hours on their bike per week
- Has SPD pedals and shoes since lives on bike
- Runs [aerobars on their bike](Aerobars%20repel%20roadies.md) for long-ride comfort
