Here are some ideas about the type of bike rider I want to find and befriend. 

- Waves at everyone including car drivers
- Stops at red lights unless it would inconvenience the other drivers
- Never does anything to provoke anyone willingly
- Smiles and ignores drivers yelling at them
- Always says hello and goodbye to other riders
- Slows down to chat a bit when passing *anyone* (even when "training")
- Attends Critical Mass religiously no matter what the weather
- Bikes to Critical Mass (instead of driving to it) from miles away if necessary
- Enters 24 Hours of Booty with other bike friends
- Averages 20+ hours on their bike per week
- Averages three hours per "training" ride
- Has lots of "bike to store" segments in Strava
- Runs 8-10% body fat from the occasional alcoholic beverage
- Tends to eat a plant-based diet
- Only wears 5-panel hats
- Runs SPD pedals and shoes on an all-road bike with 38c+ tires
- Runs [aerobars on their bike](Aerobars%20repel%20roadies.md) pretty much all the time for long-ride comfort
- Runs a Tailfin Aero rack constantly or quick release since most rides are 80+ miles
- Carries a light-weight water filter everywhere
- Actually still cares about performance and things like aero gains
- Would never run a dynamo hub because to many lost watts for no reason
- Doesn't run a handlebar bag because aero
- Wears tight-fitting lycra without a lot of logos because aero
- Rarely caught on training rides without listening to great music
- Bikes all year round outside no matter what the weather
- Doesn't mind occasional Zwift intervals and racing for power and strength training
