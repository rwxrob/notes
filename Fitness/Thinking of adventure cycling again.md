Since rediscovering that my main motivation for doing anything fitness related is pure endorphin addiction and narcissism I have felt the attraction of adventure cycling again, the kind that DKLEIN does. I still like the focus on performance but all long-distance adventure cycling has that.

The single biggest attraction to adventure cycling is not even the adventure itself but the people it attracts, their mindset, culture, and ethics. I have not found a single race-oriented, roadie with a personality that is compatible with mineâ€”let alone that I would actually admire enough to want to emulate and spend time with. There are some genuinely nice people on Strava for sure but, in my experience, the people I generally would get excited to just hang out with are often not even on Strava. I've said it before. I'm looking for people who are a mix of Dustin Klein, Terry B, and Travis Jentz, people I could go on a seriously intense ride that spans 2.5 days and actually want to talk to during large parts of it. Other parts we could be informally competing to get to the top of a hill or in a pace line to get through a bad segment of traffic.

Then again, there's just solo riding as well. I'm actually totally okay with it provided it is safe.
