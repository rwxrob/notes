Since rediscovering that my main motivation for doing anything fitness related is pure endorphin addiction and narcissism I have felt the attraction of adventure cycling again, the kind that DKLEIN does. I still like the focus on performance but all long-distance adventure cycling has that. Recently, I was reminded of this after watching Syd and Mackie do a horrible cross country ride where Syd actually said, "If every race was like that I could give up and become an accountant." On that same ride, Mackie made a comment about enjoying the support aid station, "That's kinda nice" as if it was a new concept, the inkling of an idea suggesting that you could actually focus on performance and just having fun on a *ride* instead of a *race*. That's the beauty of Gran Fondos, btw, they can be either rides or races.

The single biggest attraction to adventure cycling is not even the adventure itself but the people it attracts, their mindset, culture, and ethics. I have not found a single race-oriented, roadie with a personality that is compatible with mineâ€”let alone that I would actually admire enough to want to emulate and spend time with. In fact, 9 out of 10 roadies are completely assholes and I could actively avoid if at all possible. There are some genuinely nice roadies on Strava for sure but, in my experience, the people I generally would get excited to just hang out with are often not even on Strava. 

Then again, I'm not a fan of hanging out with MAMILs either. 

I've said it before. I'm looking for people who are a mix of Dustin Klein, Terry B, and Dylan Johnson, people I could go on a seriously intense ride that spans 2.5 days and actually want to talk to during large parts of it. Other parts we could be informally competing to get to the top of a hill or in a pace line to get through a bad segment of traffic.

Then again, there's just solo riding as well. I'm actually totally okay with it provided it is safe.
