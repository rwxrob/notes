I've had lots of opinions about adventure cycling over the years:

- [Digital Nomad by Bike was catastrophic failure](Digital%20Nomad%20by%20Bike%20was%20catastrophic%20failure.md)
- [Events instead of bikepacking](Events%20instead%20of%20bikepacking.md)
- [Bike touring is horrible for your health](Bike%20touring%20is%20horrible%20for%20your%20health.md)

I think I'm finally narrowing in on what it is that I actually *really* love: ***performance adventure cycling*** or PAC. That's a term that according to my research looks like I just invented.  I've also heard people call similar things "fastpacking" or "fast bikepacking" or "minimal bikepacking."

PAC combines two major cycling styles:

- **Adventure cycling**: Self-supported exploration off-grid and urban, occasional train rides, etc.
- **Performance cycling**: Data-driven, power-based training, and racing discipline

**PAC is something that you *train for* during the week and *do* on the weekend.**  It is characterized by relatively fast training rides—even some intervals—with nothing but tire repair kit during the week and then strapping on [an aero bikepacking bag](Best%20performance%20adventure%20cycling%20pack.md) for the weekend trip. 63mm aero rims are totally common on a PAC bike but a watt-waisting handlebar bag never would be. This puts PAC bike setups in a very specific class where comfort, aerodynamics, the least amount of weight possible. A PAC bike would never add weight to the frame just to support more load. Instead, PAC rides are designed to only carry the essentials.
