I've had lots of opinions about adventure cycling over the years:

- [Digital Nomad by Bike was catastrophic failure](Digital%20Nomad%20by%20Bike%20was%20catastrophic%20failure.md)
- [Events instead of bikepacking](Events%20instead%20of%20bikepacking.md)
- [Bike touring is horrible for your health](Bike%20touring%20is%20horrible%20for%20your%20health.md)

Adventure cycling has many forms and crosses over with bikepacking in confusing ways so I'm coining the term ***performance adventure cycling*** or PAC. I've also heard people call it "fastpacking" or "fast bikepacking" or "minimal bikepacking." PAC combines two major ways to ride a bike:

- **Adventure cycling**: Self-supported exploration off-grid and urban
- **Performance cycling**: Data-driven, power-based training, and racing discipline

PAC is something that you *train for* during the week and *do* on the weekend. It's characterized by riding fast with nothing but tire repair kit during the week and then strapping on one or two high-performance bikepacking packs for the weekend trip. 63mm aero rims are totally common on a PAC bike but a watt-waisting handlebar bag never would be. This puts PAC bike setups in a very specific class where comfort, aerodynamics, the least amount of weight possible. A PAC bike would never add weight to the frame just to support more load. Instead, PAC rides are designed to only carry the essentials.
