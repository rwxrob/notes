I've had lots of opinions about adventure cycling over the years:

- [Digital Nomad by Bike was catastrophic failure](Digital%20Nomad%20by%20Bike%20was%20catastrophic%20failure.md)
- [Events instead of bikepacking](Events%20instead%20of%20bikepacking.md)
- [Bike touring is horrible for your health](Bike%20touring%20is%20horrible%20for%20your%20health.md)

I think I'm finally narrowing in on what it is that I actually *really* love: ***performance adventure cycling*** or PAC. That's a term that according to my research looks like I just invented.  I've also heard people call similar things "fastpacking" or "fast bikepacking" or "minimal bikepacking" or "credit card touring."

PAC combines two major cycling styles:

- **Adventure cycling**: Self-supported exploration off-grid and urban, occasional train rides, etc.
- **Performance cycling**: Data-driven, power-based training, and racing discipline

Rides that fall into this category are Tour Divide and Trans Am Bike Nonstop (TABN) but these are more brutal and less enjoyable than the stuff I'm talking about. The bike setups are mostly identical, however. 63mm aero rims—and possibly even some removable aero bars—are totally common on a PAC bike but a watt-waisting handlebar bag never would be. This puts PAC bike setups in a very specific class where comfort, aerodynamics, and the least amount of weight possible. A PAC bike would never add weight to the frame just to support more load. Instead, PAC rides are designed to only carry the essentials. PAC bikes are not so extreme as a triathlon bike. In fact, a good endurance PAC bike could legally be used to compete in GFNats, which is good because the training for fun PAC rides is the same as for most Gran Fondos, which is how I discovered this (more on that later).

**PAC rides are something that you *train for* during the week and *do* on the weekend or longer.**  They are characterized by relatively fast training rides—even some intervals—with nothing but tire repair kit during the week and then strapping on [an aero bikepacking bag](Best%20performance%20adventure%20cycling%20pack.md) and some aero bars for the weekend trip.

In fact, it was on one of these 5-hour training rides on the weekend on mostly the same farm roads I use for training every day that I asked a rather obvious question, "What if I went straight instead of returning home?" I had also started fueling based on what I could find and buy rather than carry. It was also the first time I had ever even been to Cleveland, NC and I felt that child-like obsession with unlocking new areas of the map to which I'd never been. When I got home I imagined stretching out the Strava route spaghetti string to see what it could reach. That's when I knew. I could do the exact same endurance training rides and just stay overnight in a hotel and do another the next day to come home. Hell, I wouldn't even need to bring a change of clothes. I could just rinse them all out and sleep (like a rock after such rides) in the buff and get up the next day and put the same stuff back on.

The realization that I didn't even really need a pack at all do this stuff blew my mind. All I had to do was limit where I went each day and make sure that I stopped someplace with a hotel, two things that barely qualify as adventure other than not knowing in advance all the details of either.

The next mental leap wasn't hard. "What if I did add a rack/pack?" I could potentially sleep out under the stars and carry a bit of food so that I could plan routes that don't even have a lot of people nearby. Now that I have a gravel tire set I could just swap those on and unlock tons of gravel destinations like all of Two Gorges Loop.

And, of course, the idea returned, "What if I took a few weeks off and crossed the country on mostly gravel roads? How long would it take if I covered at least 100 miles per day?"

It turns out that is exactly what TABNS is. A fully self-supported crossing of the USA on the historic ACA TramsAm trail. Most participants do 150-300 miles per day to finish in 25-35 days. As grueling as it is, I wonder if I'd like that more than Tour Divide if only because I don't have to deal with bear country at all. It would be something to work up to, for sure.

Perhaps the biggest draw of PAC for me is the training is mostly just insane amounts of low-intensity volume instead of any high-intensity intervals and stuff. Endurance *means* enduring long hours in the saddle and figuring out how to enjoy them. Suffice it to say, I can start experimenting with this now and see if it is something that I actually enjoy.
