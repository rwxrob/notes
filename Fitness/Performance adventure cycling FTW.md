I've had lots of opinions about adventure cycling over the years:

- [Digital Nomad by Bike was catastrophic failure](Digital%20Nomad%20by%20Bike%20was%20catastrophic%20failure.md)
- [Events instead of bikepacking](Events%20instead%20of%20bikepacking.md)
- [Bike touring is horrible for your health](Bike%20touring%20is%20horrible%20for%20your%20health.md)

I think I'm finally narrowing in on what it is that I actually *really* love: ***performance adventure cycling*** or PAC. That's a term that according to my research looks like I just invented.  I've also heard people call similar things "fastpacking" or "fast bikepacking" or "minimal bikepacking."

PAC combines two major cycling styles:

- **Adventure cycling**: Self-supported exploration off-grid and urban, occasional train rides, etc.
- **Performance cycling**: Data-driven, power-based training, and racing discipline

Rides that fall into this category are Tour Divide and Trans Am Bike Race (TABR) but these are more brutal and less enjoyable than the stuff I'm talking about. The bike setups are mostly identical, however. 63mm aero rims—and possibly even some removable aero bars—are totally common on a PAC bike but a watt-waisting handlebar bag never would be. This puts PAC bike setups in a very specific class where comfort, aerodynamics, and the least amount of weight possible. A PAC bike would never add weight to the frame just to support more load. Instead, PAC rides are designed to only carry the essentials.

**PAC rides are something that you *train for* during the week and *do* on the weekend or longer.**  They are characterized by relatively fast training rides—even some intervals—with nothing but tire repair kit during the week and then strapping on [an aero bikepacking bag](Best%20performance%20adventure%20cycling%20pack.md) and some aero bars for the weekend trip.
