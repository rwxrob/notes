*At the end of May I changed my [long term cycling goal](Long%20term%20cycling%20goals.md) to complete Bike Nonstop US in under over any competition in GFNats. Many of the short-term fitness goals overlap but not all. The focus from May onward in 2025

Season goals:

- Complete body transformations
- Integrate competitive endurance training back into daily life

Training objectives:

- Build the foundation of a Gran Fondo GC/climber body
- Restore competitive body composition: <10% body fat, ~68 kilos
- Get amateur event experience, restore bike handling skills, race craft
- Completely dial in nutrition strategy on and off bike
- Perfect optimal bike configuration for training and racing
- 280 FTP, power/strength is *not* the focus for 2025

Key training elements:

- Remember 2025 is year of preparation to be competitive in 2026
- Pro volume even though not shooting for pro events
- Almost entirely low-intensity base endurance training
