*On June 21 I changed my mind again following a painful but amicable split with my wife of 13 years. It pretty much destroyed my training and plans for 2025. I will be doing the events but only as social events involving bikes. My goal to do BNSUS is also dead. After watching them I realize I have no desire to **really** do that*.

----
*At the end of May I changed my main [long term cycling goal](Long%20term%20cycling%20goals.md) to complete Bike Nonstop US in under 30 days with 7 hours of sleep per day and biking mostly during the day for safety reasons. Before it was competing in Gran Fondo Nationals. Many of the short-term fitness goals overlap but not all:

- Remove any and all strength and intensity training
- Focus entirely on sustainable pace and quickest possible recovery
- Train gut to take in on-the-road carbs to keep energy and recovery high
- Add ultra-high volume with at least one century per week
- More yoga to create a body that can maintain ultra-distance comfort in the saddle
- Focus on fun (which reduces stress and speed recovery) over speed without sacrificing speed
- Add one or two bivy overnighters per week

Season goals:

- Complete body transformations
- Integrate competitive endurance training back into daily life

Training objectives:

- Build the foundation of a Gran Fondo GC/climber body
- Restore competitive body composition: <10% body fat, ~68 kilos
- Get amateur event experience, restore bike handling skills, race craft
- Completely dial in nutrition strategy on and off bike
- Perfect optimal bike configuration for training and racing
- 280 FTP, power/strength is *not* the focus for 2025

Key training elements:

- Remember 2025 is year of preparation to be competitive in 2026
- Pro volume even though not shooting for pro events
- Almost entirely low-intensity base endurance training
