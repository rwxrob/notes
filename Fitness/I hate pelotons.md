There, I said it. I seem to go through this evolution every time I get back into cycling. Here's how it goes:
- I just start riding slow to get healthy.
- Then I start picking up the pace and watch Tour de France and race on Zwift and think I want to race
- Then I do a few local group rides and hate them but push through because I think group make me fast
- Then I remember what assholes the riders who like pelotons *mostly* are
- Then I remember everything bad that has happened on a bike has usually involved a group
- Then I realize people doing stupid shit is more likely in a group that is out of my control. Then I get depressed and just start putting on huge volume on lonely roads listening to music and start wondering "what if I kept going?" Then I Then I say, "to hell with pelotons!" and adopt a variation of the sport that does not require them. At first it was triathlon, then cross-country mountain biking where drafting isn't often a thing, and later [performance adventure cycling](Fitness/Performance%20adventure%20cycling%20FTW.md). It is at that point when I rethink my entire bike setup and buy bags for my bike. I also stop looking at the Gran Fondo routes and start making ultra-distance, slow routes through interesting places (like [Davidson to Asheville (Shortest)](Davidson%20to%20Asheville%20(Shortest).md)).

I feel so much better coming to terms with that.

Pelotons are where the worst shit out of my control on a bike has happened to me every time. This stuff doesn't happen in a time trial or triathlon.
