There, I said it. I seem to go through this evolution every time I get back into cycling. At first I just start riding slow to get healthy, then I start picking up the pace and watch Tour de France and race on Zwift and think I want to do that in the real world. Then I do a few local group rides and hate them but push through because I think I want to be fast and require a group or team to really have fun. Then I remember what assholes the riders who like pelotons *mostly* are. Then I get depressed and just start putting on huge volume on lonely roads listening to music and start wondering "what if I kept going?" Then I say, "to hell with pelotons!" and adopt a variation of the sport that does not require them. At first it was triathlon, then cross-country mountain biking where drafting isn't often a thing, and later [performance adventure cycling](Fitness/Performance%20adventure%20cycling%20FTW.md). It is at that point when I rethink my entire bike setup and buy bags for my bike. I also stop looking at the Gran Fondo routes
