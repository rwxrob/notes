There, I said it. I seem to go through this evolution every time I get back into cycling. Here's how it goes:

- I just start riding slow to get healthy.
- Then I start picking up the pace and watch Tour de France and race on Zwift and think I want to race
- Then I do a few local group rides and hate them but push through because I think group make me fast
- Then I remember what assholes the riders who like pelotons *mostly* are
- Then I remember everything bad that has happened on a bike has usually involved a group
- Then I realize people doing stupid shit is more likely in a group
- Then I get depressed and just start putting on huge volume on lonely roads listening to music
- Then I wonder "what if I kept going?"
- Then I start to bike 100k per day and wonder why I don't put my aerobars on
- Then I say, "to hell with pelotons!" and adopt a variation of the sport that does not require them
- Then I put the aerobars on and wonder why the hell I didn't do that months ago (or ever stopped)
- Then I start wondering what events I can do with aerobars
- Then I start planning for Tour Divide or Bike Nonstop US
- Then I add bags to and other weight to my bike and cl
- Then I start hating riding my bike because I'm slow

- . At first it was triathlon, then cross-country mountain biking where drafting isn't often a thing, and later [performance adventure cycling](Fitness/Performance%20adventure%20cycling%20FTW.md). It is at that point when I rethink my entire bike setup and buy bags for my bike. I also stop looking at the Gran Fondo routes and start making ultra-distance, slow routes through interesting places (like [Davidson to Asheville (Shortest)](Davidson%20to%20Asheville%20(Shortest).md)).

I feel so much better coming to terms with that.

Pelotons are where the worst shit out of my control on a bike has happened to me every time. This stuff doesn't happen in a time trial or triathlon.
