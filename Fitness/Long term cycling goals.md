 This note has been revised a lot in 2025. Cycling has moved from a primary goal to a secondary one supporting the main goal of maintaining exceptionally good health going into old age. Cycling is also just a way of transport to accomplish another primary goal: becoming a cycling videographer and culture journalist.
 
 Here's my target body specs:

| **Metric**      | **Target**                 |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Weight**      | 70.0 kg                    |
| **FTP**         | **300 watts**              |
| **Body fat**    | 6â€“10%                      |
| **Ride volume** | ~24 hrs/week (~1,200+ TSS) |

Most importantly this means my training will be focused on the fat-as-fuel energy pathway entirely and gut-training to be able to eat any foods that I can find across America. This requires a completely different training plan than that for most bike race events. It also requires training things outside fitness like mechanic skills and riding and sleeping in hostile weather conditions safely and comfortably.
