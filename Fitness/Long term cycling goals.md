I want to complete the Bike Nonstop US in under 30 days. Ambitious? Sure but why not. It will take several years to get there but I like having goals. It's fun to remember I didn't even fit into my clothes in December. I've made a ton of progress and I don't see that changing. I'm in it for the long haul and playing the long game, as they say.Sure I'll probably never even come close but it will be fun to work on it. Here's my target body specs:

| **Metric**      | **Target**                 |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Weight**      | 67.0 kg                    |
| **FTP**         | **300 watts**              |
| **Body fat**    | 6â€“8%                       |
| **Ride volume** | ~24 hrs/week (~1,200+ TSS) |

Most importantly this means my training will be focused on the fat-as-fuel energy pathway entirely and gut-training to be able to eat any foods that I can find across America. This is completely different from training for most other bike races.
