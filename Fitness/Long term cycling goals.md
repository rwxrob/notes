I want to complete the Bike Nonstop US in under 30 days. Ambitious? Sure but why not. It will take several years to get there but I like having goals. It's fun to remember I didn't even fit into my clothes in December 2024. I've made a ton of progress and I don't see that changing. I'm in it for the long haul and playing the long game, as they say. Sure I'll probably never even come close but it will be fun to work on it. Here's my target body specs:

| **Metric**      | **Target**                 |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Weight**      | 67.0 kg                    |
| **FTP**         | **300 watts**              |
| **Body fat**    | 6â€“8%                       |
| **Ride volume** | ~24 hrs/week (~1,200+ TSS) |

Most importantly this means my training will be focused on the fat-as-fuel energy pathway entirely and gut-training to be able to eat any foods that I can find across America. This requires a completely different training plan than that for most bike race events. It also requires training things outside fitness like mechanic skills and riding and sleeping in hostile weather conditions safely and comfortably.
