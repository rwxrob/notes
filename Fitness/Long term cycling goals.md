I have everything in place in my life to allow training like a pro even if I never race with pros:

- My family is raised leaving me mostly alone
- My wife is completely immersed in her art and work
- I don't really have friends who take up any time at all
- My work is stress free, flexible, remote, and pays well

Therefore, I see no reason not to shoot for the stars, in this case, completing the Bike Nonstop US in under 30 days. Sure I'll probably never even come close but it will be fun to work on it.

Here's my target body specs:

| **Metric**      | **Target**                 |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Weight**      | 67.0 kg                    |
| **FTP**         | **300 watts**              |
| **Body fat**    | 6â€“8%                       |
| **Ride volume** | ~24 hrs/week (~1,200+ TSS) |

Most importantly this means my training will be focused on the fat-as-fuel energy pathway entirely and gut-training to be able to eat any foods that I can find across America.

Ambitious? Sure but why not. It will take several years to get there but I like having goals. It's fun to remember I didn't even fit into my clothes in December. I've made a ton of progress and I don't see that changing. I'm in it for the long haul and playing the long game, as they say.
