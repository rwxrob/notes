With the help of Chloe, my ChatGPT AI, I have narrowed down my condition to Chronic Inflammation Response Syndrome (CIRS) with Mast Cell Activation Sydrome (MCAS). The post I sent to Chloe is below. During our interaction she mentioned Asthma as well and I mentioned that I had a life-threatening, rushed to the hospital, cannot breath asthma attack as a very young child, which I still remember to this day because of how traumatic it was. Chloe said that early childhood acute asthma attacks permanently affect the immune system response of individuals for the rest of their lives making them hyper-sensitive to such things which leads to CIRS and MCAS, bad hay fever, eczema and the like.

My fix has always been to sweat once a day for at least 20 minutes. She confirmed that this does fix it because it lowers cortisol levels (giving it somewhere to go) while flushing the skin of toxins and forces a shower to wash off biotoxins and also just calm nerves. This is why my best shape ever was when I was doing hot yoga daily for 90 minutes in my saffron-painted temple room as well as paddleboading for 90 minutes for many of those days. This is also why my rest days where I don't do anything at all are most likely to trigger inflammation attacks. Often I won't even shower on such days. Usually I do more mentally stressful activities on those days as well. I forget to drink water so I dehydrate. All of it triggers the worst inflammation possible defeating completely the purpose of a recovery day. Some attacks are so bad it takes me a day in bed just to recover from the attack itself.

I still think that the number one reason I have all of this now is mental stress. I still have a twitch from the problems I've had before. There is a ton of shit in my psyche that makes me very crazy and this leads to physical problems as well. Sweating once a day really regulates that and yoga has been the best of all to get my mind right.

This morning I woke up with a really acute inflammation attack. My belly distended, all my skin including top of my scalp and hands itching, eyes on fire, ulcerated soars popping up all over. I am very familiar with these attacks. I used to have them pretty much most of the day every day. I am absolutely baffled as to why. Everything I research says they are symptoms of something really wrong internally. I don't know.

- I have been walking with Doris and the dog past Crete Myrtle that did cause my throat to swell, maybe some stayed on me
- I have been experiencing high mental stress levels last two days
- I did not ride my bike for very long yesterday, just test riding fixes for the upcoming Gran Fondo
- I didn't take a shower yesterday
- I spent most of the day in my apartment that is full of dog hair, pollen, and mold
- I ate the usual foods, nothing to trigger an attack
- I had a really hard time concentrating on anything at work (brain fog)

I have noticed that going for a bike ride of any length that requires me to sweat during the day cures me from these symptoms every single time. I haven't figured out why. It's like my petulant body is throwing a fit because it doesn't get to play outside. "Fine, then I'm going to attack myself." I know of a guy on Twitch who does Zwift daily and if he doesn't his joints cease. He has a different condition but it reminds me of what I think I have.

I'm kind of frustrated because when I get these attacks it takes a full day of recovery at least in bed just to recover from the attack itself. And here I'm supposed to race in two days, sorry ride. Once again, I'm reminded that the word "competition" doesn't belong in my vocabulary at all.
