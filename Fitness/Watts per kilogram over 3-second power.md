 I recently have heard from several pros on YouTube who matter-of-factly mentioned that W/kg is their primary indicator on their bike computers since that is the number that makes them competitive. It's also the number used everywhere within Zwift. Having that number as the main one (instead of 3 second power) at a glance motivates me in all the right ways and takes a lot of the guess work out because 3.1 W/kg is much easier to grok quickly. Using W/kg doesn't work at all without daily updates to weight that are reliably consistent.
