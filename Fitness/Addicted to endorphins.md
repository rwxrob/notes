After a few really tough workouts the last few weeks I have realized that I actually don't want to really be on the podium. As competitive as I am what I *really* want is to be constantly flooded with endorphins. I'm addicted. I always have been. I think that is why I like triathlon so much because it was a way to maximize endorphins by working different parts of the body so one part doesn't burn out beyond recovery. Open water swimming, for example, is a major endorphin builder for me. I live on a fucking lake. Why am I not doing more things on it? There aren't even boats on this part of the lake. The great thing about open water swimming is there is no pollen or allergies to contend with.
