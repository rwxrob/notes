This [route](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/50948539) is the shortest and least scenic but probably best when performance is the goal. The climbs are in all the right places as are the gradual descents. The route gets just rural enough to be interesting without being too disconnected from society to be dangerous. The challenge with this route is the timing. I would *never* do this unless it was a Sunday at dawn. This means that the traffic will be minimal but it also means a lot of stuff is closed so I have to make absolutely sure I can support myself completel
