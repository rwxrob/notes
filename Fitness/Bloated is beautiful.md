I couldn't help notice how bloated my shadow is on these rides. I used to feel self-conscious. Now I just know that my gut is doing its damndest to figure out what to do with all the carbs I'm dumping into it. Bloating means my gut is trying to work harder, that's all. Does it look sexy? Hell no. And it will get less as my gut adapts and I continue to lose more fat. For now, I just associate it with the amazing training recovery that comes from it that I already can see is producing amazing results. I might be bloated but I'm a lot faster and can go a lot longer because of it. I can look pretty when I get home.
