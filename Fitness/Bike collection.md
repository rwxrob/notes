I ride for the vibes and fitness. While I love a good jump, chase, or placing in my age group, I mostly ride because I just love it and how it makes me feel. By bike choices should not be a surprise. I stick with the bigger brands because they have the best support nationally.

The Domane (all-road) is my main bike and has three wheel sets:

1. Swiss-side 26/28c, 63mm deep aero, tubeless (most of the year)
2. Stock bontrager, 32c, tubeless (winter, slam them up)
3. Maxxis rambler 40c, tubeless (light gravel)
