I ride mostly for the vibes and fitness but I'm also pretty damn competitive. When I race it is mostly against myself with an occasional group dynamic. For all-out crit racing and race-craft I'm on the indoor bike. Don't want to break a collar-bone, or a hip. The most competitive racing I do outside is usually endurance based. gran fondos and gravel where the risk is a lot less than road racing or criteriums. 
I stick with the bigger brands because they have the best support nationally.

The Domane (all-road) is my main bike and has three wheel sets:

1. Swiss-side 26/28c, 63mm deep aero, tubeless (most of the year)
2. Stock bontrager, 32c, tubeless (winter, slam them up)
3. Maxxis rambler 38/40c, tubeless (light gravel)

My Salsa Marrakesh (which I don't ride much any more because it is so slow) has two wheel sets:

1. 38 Renee Herse slicks, tubeless (roads)
2. Vittoria Mescal 2.1, tubeless (everything else)
