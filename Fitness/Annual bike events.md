| Date       | Event                                                                                 | Cost | Travel |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--: | :----- |
| **Jul 20** | [Gran Fondo Asheville](https://www.granfondonationalseries.com/gran-fondo-asheville/) | $160 | 126    |
| **Aug 3**  | [Boone Gran Fondo](https://www.granfondonationalseries.com/gran-fondo-boone/)         | $160 | 98     |
| *Aug 17*   | [Lake Norman Gran Fondo](https://lakenormanfondo.com/) *                              | $80  | 5      |

Here are other events that look fun but I've eliminated for reasons, usually just not worth the cost:
