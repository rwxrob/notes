1. Lap W/kg - solid segment target based on event goals, sanity check
2. Heart rate - am I warmed up? overreaching? dehydrated?
3. W/kg - main metric all load (automatically updated from daily weigh in)
4. Distance - how much do I have left, perfect when riding same loop daily
5. Duration - when to drink and eat and if I'm going to make it before a sunset
6. 
7.

*Old information for reference.*

Here are the essential Garmin stats I have and why:

1. 10 second power - best indication of power trend, smooths spikes and recoveries
2. Normalized power - best indicator of how hard been going all ride so far
3. Cadence - good sanity check that I glance at when seeing other things
4. Duration - when to drink and eat and if I'm going to make it before a sunset
5. Distance - how much left do I have, perfect when riding same loop daily
6. Temperature - when to pull out the windbreaker, helps tweak kit selections
7. Time of day - reality check and general sunset warning

I do not have heart rate because I hate wearing that strap. I've written a lot about how valuable HR is and I still believe that. Riding the same loop every day, however, allows me to make all the decisions I need while riding based on all these other stats instead. This really helps me dial in my actual PE better. I never want to be looking at my stats during a race anyway, unless it is perhaps on a break away, but even then.
