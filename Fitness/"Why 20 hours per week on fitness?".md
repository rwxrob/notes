Because I work from home and would hardly move at all without it. The average job that doesn't require only waking up and getting on a computer probably counts for about 10 hours of physical activity per week. So to those people 10 hours of fitness activity (anything that makes you sweat) is probably more reasonable. The old "30 minutes of exercise per day" doesn't work if every other minute is barely moving at all.
