Having a consistent morning routine seems to be the best way for me to get the training right. I've experimented with doing the same thing later in the day and while it seems okay the morning routine—at least for the hotter months—makes more sense. It also simulates the same sort of thing on race day. I'm not putting an exact time, however.

- Wake, check watch, pee
- Make two cups coffee (2x2-2 setting, 200ml)
- Bake waffle and six eggs hard-boiled for later
- Drink 400 ml water or Huel (depending on what's coming)
- Consume waffle, water/shake, coffee while making notes
- Go outside and checking weather and TP, making daily notes
- Void and weigh myself (consistent clothing)
- Start the day
