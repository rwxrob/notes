Having a consistent morning routine seems to be the best way for me to get the training right. I've experimented with doing the same thing later in the day and while it seems okay the morning routine—at least for the hotter months—makes more sense. It also simulates the same sort of thing on race day. I'm not putting an exact time, however.

- Wake, check watch, pee, drink 200ml water
- Make and start drinking cup coffee (2-2 setting, 100ml)
- Bake waffle and six eggs hard-boiled for later
- Consume waffle coffee while making notes and updating training plan
- Go outside and check weather forecast, sip coffee on steps if nice
- Void and weigh in
- Drink 400 ml water or Huel (depending on what's coming)
- Start the day smiling
