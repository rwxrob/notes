My Domane is the perfect bike for me. I can quickly add the TailFin Cargo pack and aerobars when doing [performance adventure cycling](Fitness/Performance%20adventure%20cycling%20FTW.md) or just training to far-flung locations here locally and then remove them when ([and if](Fitness/I%20hate%20pelotons.md)) I ever do any rides that don't allow them. This is much better than a dedicated triathlon bike. I can keep my 63m deep rims because they are best when going it alone in any capacity. They are literally the best road wheels for all-road solo rides anywhere.
