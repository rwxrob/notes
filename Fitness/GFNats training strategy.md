*My personal goals no longer include GFNats

Each of the USA Cycling Gran Fondo National Series (GFNats) events is just a big spicy fully-supported century group ride with four specific all-out competitive segments followed by 100% full recovery slowly riding to the next one and taking a fully-catered break on top of that. It's like four 10-30 minute road races for the price of one or one big 4x20 @110% interval session spread out over 6-7 hours. ðŸ˜‰ So how do I train for this?
## Endurance for seven hours

Before I can do any other skills training I have to be able to ride 161 kilometers in seven hours with four off-bike refueling breaks every 40k. If my body won't even do that I have no business working on anything elseâ€”or even entering any of these events at that distance.
## Gut training for high carb intake

Along with training for the century length I have to prepare my body to use mostly carbs as fuel. Whether the intensity flips my primary energy source from fat to carb or the longer duration does I just can't do any of this unless I train my body to take in as much energy as I'm spending.
## *Fatigued* 20-minute power

If all I was doing was a 10-30 minute road race I might as well just train to be a sprinter. Once you add in all the bursting for attacking and chasing in such a race that's all it would be, an almost dangerously fast road race or criterium. Thankfully, these races are part of the larger century race so the pace will be significantly subdued by the fatigue that will have set in but it will still be very spicy.
### Attacking and chasing

All the advantages I dutifully trained hours a day for are obliterated if I end up just pulling someone who puts in less effort to the end. On the flip side, if I'm weaker than another rider but have the skills to burst and hold the wheel while putting out a lot less power I can blow them up mentally and physically.

These skills are only things I can train in a very spicy group setting. I'll have to find the spiciest group and go for it, or not. These are not things that I really have to train that hard for because I do still have a fair amount of criterium and road racing in my past that I still remember. But wouldn't hurt so long as such rides don't interfere with the higher training priorities. 20 minute power is way more important than breaking and chasing.

This unique quality of these specific official GFNat events makes them very specialâ€”and wonderful. It also makes training for them *entirely* different than what most people expect.

Training for a century ride that only counts the 10 and 20-minute segments for competitive points requires a much different training focus:

- Massive amounts of low-intensity volume
- Focus on weight and comfort over power and aero
- Train to go as slow as possible *with stops* and keeping above 16 kph "progression average time"
- Dial in best rolling resistance possible (tubeless 28c or more at 58-65 psi)
- Train gut on nutrition specifically available from aid stations of these events

**Dropping weight.**  Lower weight matters way more than higher power for all of these events. In fact, building FTP is a horrible idea until weight is in an acceptable area. I was shooting for 70 kg but now I'm going to go even lower. This means tons more base training miles to keep a healthy caloric deficit. I'll only be able to hit 72 for Asheville but should hit 68 by Nationals. I cannot screw this up. It's the most important thing I can do besides maintain base fitness.

**Lighten bike.** My bike is already as light as it can go. I'll just not carry my phone nor my pump and pack. I'm also going to practice emptying a 750 ml bottle completely and only doing the climb with a single empty one. All the climbs are reasonably within the tolerance of doing it intensely and recovering after it is done so carrying any extra water is really bad. This is especially true because I can fully recover at a rest stop after pushing to my maximum and burning all the matches on every climb segment.

**Rolling resistance.** I'm going to put some ultra light 32m tubeless tires on my aero wheels (which are still lighter than every other wheel set I have). Hitting those small bumps in the road going up that kind of grade has a tremendous impact on forward momentum and balance. Running a much lower air pressure is far more important than having an aero tire. This also makes the recovery on the long distances in between timed segments that much more cozy and also enables me to last longer in the saddle when doing training rides, which I've decided again will be at least three hours every time.

**Nutrition from aid stations.** Carrying my own nutrition up the hill is a huge liabilityâ€”especially for the first two climb segments. Trying to carry the calories I need to fuel the entire event with me during the whole event is simply foolish. It would probably weigh almost a full kilogram of extra weight when I could just refuel at the support stations. This is *only* because of the timed segment setup. The Suarez official events are also well stocked with actual good fuel sources so I likely do not need anything. I do, however, need to practice gut training for the exact same foods that will be available at the aide stations and I need to do the research to determine what that will be.

**Hill climb training.** I do have a lot of hills in my normal training but I don't currently have a lot of *long* hills. I need to scope those out and ride only those since those are the segments I will be timed on. I really need to find one good hill that is the maximum distance of any timed climbing segment on any of the official events I'm focused on. This specificity should be over the top compared to the competition.

**Group rides are useless.** It makes my heart sing to learn that I don't need no group rides to do what I really need.

**So happy.**  I absolutely love that I discovered all this and found GFNat official events. Training for these events completely jives with favorite way to ride a bike, in a comfortable, upright position taking in the scenery without suffering in aero position, taking stops whenever I feel like it but then kicking ass on a hill climb every once in a while for some excitement. These are my favorite type of rides and groups who appreciate the same thing. This is what originally attracted me to bike touring. In fact, you could say that the way GFNat is designed it caters to people who enjoy bike touring but just want to drop the heavy bike and gear and compete every once in a while. In fact, bike touring all by itself is *excellent* training for these events. Peloton skills are certainly valuable in general but they have absolutely no bearing on competitive results of these events because the speeds are so slow on the climbs the aerodynamic gains of pack riding are negligible. That's right. You don't even have to be in a pack to win. If I am light enough and have a kick-ass 10-minute power I can dominate without ever drafting off a single wheel. This makes me so happy I cannot even say. I fucking hate most pelotons. They are filled with dangerous egomaniacs and Karens who all think they are god's gift to cycling. I got nothing against them wanting to do their thing in their way. I just want nothing to do with it. This is why I [hate Cheaha Challenge](Cheaha%20Challenge%20is%20a%20bad%20joke.md) and loved triathlons so much. There's no cheating. You either have the fitness or you don't. You cannot make up for it by sucking someone's wheel or rejoining the group because of some traffic anomaly, or winning the race because your competition was taken out by an idiot cross-wheeling in front of him. I fucking *love* this because it allows those who have really put in the time to shine above all the rest. To compete in these events takes massive dedication and time, way more than the average road racer or group ride sprinter. This is what I was looking for. Now I just have to put in the hours.
