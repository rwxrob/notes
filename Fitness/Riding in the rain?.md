Even though rain itself does not qualify as [unridable weather](Unridable%20weather.md) to me I never choose to ride in it. Two out of the maybe four times in the last two years that I decided to ride willingly in the rain I crashed. Both were because of insanely slippery roads that were like riding on ice, one from that light, slippery silt mud that forms in puddles on a greenway (which cost me $300 to buy a new phone that got dosed because the phone holder broke) and another from a simple turn on a popular suburban route that surfaced just enough oil (which really left me with a lot of road rash making it hard to train for a month). Every other time I'm crashed in those years has been while mountain biking, which is why I don't do much mountain biking these days. Too much risk for the reward even if I absolutely love the adrenaline rush of single track.

You could argue that lonely farm roads are pretty immune from the effects of bad rain but you have to get to them. Then there's the higher lightning risk when the rain comes from thunderstorms. Then there is the crazy high speeds of those flat descents where going down wouldn't just give me road rash in a neighborhood full of people asking if they can help.

There are other minor reasons:

- More flats when it rains
- Have to clean the bike
- Wears down bike faster
- Uncomfortable unless mount fenders every time
- Decreases visibility to drivers

I know that *tons* of bike riders of all types will find my fair-weather position on the rain somewhat wimpy. I would have thought that at one point myself. I just love my last years on Earth too much and want to prolong them way too much. The bottom line, however, is much simpler: I don't get as much enjoyment or training effect from riding in the rain when I could ride on the trainer instead.
