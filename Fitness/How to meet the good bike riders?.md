Here are some ideas about how to attract the exact type of rider I want to find and befriend. What type of person is such a rider?

- Never does anything to provoke anyone
- Always says hello and goodbye
- Slows down to chat a bit when passing *anyone* (even when "training")
- Attends Critical Mass religiously no matter
