Now I'm gonna rant about demonizing people who put in "high volume." I totally kept my mouth shut at one rest stop when several others were going off on the riders who put more than 20 hours in. At first it was just fun jabbing. Then it got downright mean. "They don't have kids...or lives" one person said.  
  
I was hoping that these people didn't see I've had top volume and longest ride in the Strava group at least three weeks in the last two months. I'm fat. I have a lot to burn off to get competitive. So I make the time. I even attend work meetings while on the bike on the road or on the trainer. Guess what? I'm not the only one.  
  
I once knew a competitive marathoner who had two small children to raise. They could not be left alone for a second. She was constantly with them and she also put in massive training volume on the indoor treadmill. "I would lose my mind if I didn't have this." She put in the work and was better for it rather than growing to resent the commitments to her family she had made. She's Fing amazing. Would you say she didn't have a life for putting that volume in? Hell no!  
  
Here's what I wanted to say but didn't:  
  
Sure my kids are grown and I have more time now but you know what, I also put that volume in when I had kids and I was still a great dad. It meant I was up at 5am and often at the gym in the pool or on some lonely roads by myself putting in the miles. Not only did I have young kids, but I also had a Mormon church calling. I owned that shit and had great results.  
  
There's no excuse. Don't demonize the people who choose to do this with their precious free time because you need to feel better about yourself. How about praising their commitment to something that you also love. Own that you just don't have the desire—or, more likely, the dedication—to actually put in the work. This isn't about them. It's about you and whatever insecurities you harbor. Why disparage others for doing what they love?
