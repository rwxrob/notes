I once purchased a scooter to commute to work in Arizona. I took it back and got a motorcycle instead. Why? Because the scooter was just so dangerous. I could not keep up with traffic so cars had to constantly pass me at high speed. With the motorcycle I could pass them if I wanted.

The same goes for road bikes. When on my slow, long-haul Salsa loaded down so that pushing 250w only gets me about 15 kph there is no way I can maneuver around or keep up with traffic. I'm completely at the mercy of the traffic. On my minimal, speedy Domane averaging 30-40 kph on the flats, however, I very frequently exceed the traffic speed on my route and can  use the traffic to my advantage or get around it. This average speed allows me to merge easily with traffic and just appear more like an actual vehicle instead of an obstacle to be dealt with.

It follows, however, that this makes road bikes much less safe on any sidewalk and most greenway walking trails. Thankfully the greenways on my Goblin Medio route are designed with relatively high-speed cycling in mind. They don't have turns that are too tight or roots breaking up the asphalt. Huntersville particularly understands the needs of the cycling community more than even Davidson.
