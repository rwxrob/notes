Training by week is stupid. There I said it. Weekly divisions are absolutely arbitrary.  I use 3:1 and 2:1 load/absorb blocks, sometimes an overreaching 5:1 followed by a de-load block when preparing for an event.

**Cycle 1**
- Day 1: 4 hr Z2 long ride
- Day 2: Fatigued 20-min workout (Workout A)
- Day 3: Tempo ride (2 × 20 @ 90–95% FTP)
- Day 4: OFF or 1 hr Z1 spin

**Cycle 2**
- Day 1: 3–4 hr Z2 with big climb
- Day 2: 2-a-day (AM Z2 + PM 20-min threshold)
- Day 3: VO2 intervals (3 × 8 min @ 105–110%)
- Day 4: Yoga + 30 min walk
