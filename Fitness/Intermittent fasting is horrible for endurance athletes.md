I'm so tired of hearing endurance influencer idiots say that people should try intermittent fasting. Only people who have really screwed up their systems should even consider it as a drastic measure before starting to take pills for years of screwing up their systems. Here are the scientific side-effects of caloric restriction:

- Stops testosterone, thyroid, and growth hormone production
- Blocks protein synthesis
- Prevents topping off glycogen stores
- Increases illness from reduced micronutrients

Sure it might eventually reset insulin resistance but that should have been taken care of _before_ you screwed up your system by becoming overweight, lethargic, or just taking in too much raw sugar.

Ironically, you won't even lose weight by doing this. In fact, you'll end up stressing your body out so badly that it will produce cortisol and cause you to put on weight most of the time.

Instead, eat fewer meals throughout the day to give your digestive system a rest and make sure those meals have everything needed which will ensure the total GI number for the meal is low enough to fuel you for a few hours without fermentation. That will keep you from getting hungry. Also make sure the meals you eat contain food that does not cause you gut distress in any way, for some this will mean low-FODMAP stuff. You want the food to cover all the bases, get digested relatively quickly without spiking insulin, and then exit so your body can use that fuel for the next several hours without to much work to use it.
