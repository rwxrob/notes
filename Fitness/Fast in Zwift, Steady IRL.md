Yet another conclusion I'm having, again, is that the place to truly test speed and race craft in ways that I care about is on Zwift where the only thing that matters is watts per kilo and knowing how to use the power ups. Sure people cheat their asses off in Zwift but they do for Gran Fondos as well. Hell, drafting in a peloton like at Cheaha is cheating all by itself. Some fat bastard with a high FTP drafts the whole way only to get unfair advantage from all the other people plowing through the wind for him. That's as much bullshit as any Zwift cheating.

Zwift still has all the "match burning" competition. It also has a much safer way to do one of my favorite things, sprint. Sprinting IRL is a broken hip or collar bone waiting to happen. In Zwift it is just pure watts.
