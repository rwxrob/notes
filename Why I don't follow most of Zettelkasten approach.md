Luhmann created Zettelkasten at a time when computers were not really an option. Many of the physical limitations of his system proved very useful but those same constraints can be followed today while still leveraging the power of modern computers where it makes sense to do so. This speeds the process and gets the medium out of the way. Obsidian is one such system. 

The unique identifier system from Luhmann was completely necessary for the time but a radically over-complicating measure now that we can simply link to the name of the file and use human-readable names that double as titles or subtitles. This makes graphs and outlines incredibly easy to follow without obfuscating the actual knowledge contained therein.

The only principle from the Zettelkasten workflow that I follow is the **_one main thought_** principle. This ensures I don't repeat myself all over the place and that the content is as composable as possible when it comes time to create published documents, be they books or blogs.
