It's not something I'd recommend anyone else do but I have successfully done a 1-week protein fast in the past. It can be a devastating blow to fitness and endurance training but does drop weight about 5 kilograms. It's also a good opportunity to catch up on all the things in life done that get put off when doing 20 hours of training per week and maintaining a full-time job.

- 1.6 grams per kilo so I'm just using 200g per day
- Mix up protein sources between eggs, chicken, and protein powder
- Take a daily multivitamin and fish oil supplement
- Drink 3-4 liters of water daily with electrolyte powder ()
