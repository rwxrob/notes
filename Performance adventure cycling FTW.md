Adventure cycling has many forms and crosses over with bikepacking in confusing ways so I'm coining the term **performance adventure cycling** or PAC. I've also heard people call it "fastpacking" or "fast bikepacking" or "minimal bikepacking." PAC combines two major ways to ride a bike:

- **Adventure cycling**: Self-supported exploration off-grid and urban
- **Performance cycling**: Data-driven, power-based training, and racing discipline

PAC is something that you *train for* during the week and *do* on the weekend. It's characterized by riding fast with nothing but tire repair kit during the week and then strapping on one or two high-performance bikepacking packs for the weekend trip. 63mm aero rims are totally common on a PAC bike but a watt-waisting handlebar bag never would be. This puts PAC bike setups in a very specific class where comfort, aerodynamics, the least amount of weight possible. A PAC bike would never add weight to the frame just to support more load. Instead, PAC rides are designed to only carry the essentials.
