I've put studs into my knobby tires to ride in ice storms for my 20 mile commute in Portland, Oregon. I know there is nothing really "unrideable" but for me drawing the line someplace makes all the other routine logistics just a lot less time consuming to think about.

- No daylight
- <0C
- Serious thunderstorms with lightning and wind hazard
