The main criterion is simple: will my normal training quality be affected by the weather?

- No daylight - not safe for normal training speeds, not fun, don't want extra lights to manage
- Freezing temps - risk of ice, not fun, better on lungs to train indoors
- Over 32 degrees - too hard to maintain hydration and electrolytes compared to indoors
- Soaking rain and < 10 degrees - no gear can maintain optimal training conditions compared to indoor
- Serious thunderstorms with lightning and wind hazard - stupid dangerous, down branches risk, etc.

I've put studs into my knobby tires to ride in ice storms for my 20 mile commute in Portland, Oregon. I know there is nothing really "unrideable" but for me drawing the line someplace makes all the other routine logistics just a lot less time consuming to think about. I never wan to sacrifice training quality just to prove how tough I am to myself (been there, done that).
