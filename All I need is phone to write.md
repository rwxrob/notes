As I sit here, sipping my coffee from the patio outside with nothing but my phone and my coffee, I realize how amazing it is to just write at the speed of thought.

they say that good writing is easy to speak aloud, and this makes it all the better, because I can hear myself rather than just type it away.

The only downside of this type of writing is obviously the lack of capitalization and good punctuation. but as long as it's just going into my notes with obsidian, I don't need to care about that until i'm ready to put it into a blog or whatever. at that point, I'll run it through my chatgpt ai and make sure it's really clean.

The second part of the writing process in this case is having a wordpress blog with the app that goes with it. this is particularly great because I can take photos and snapshots, and even if I wanted to publish g p x files from my phone directly to my blog, and then just release them when they're published. this is a great activity when you're just in the tent or resting from a long ride.

Important thing here is I don't even have to carry a computer with me at all anywhere I go. All I need is my trusty phone which I already need.Because I do a lot of live streaming and use it for chat and navigation, and all the rest of that stuff.

All this motivates me to find far off places to hide and to just sit there with my thoughts and write them by speaking them into my phone. And then having a snack getting back on my bike and heading back home.

I don't know how to explain it, but this is important because it allows me to still enjoy it something when I know that i'm not gonna be able to share it with friends in real time. i do hope some young person out there who loves to be outside and to write. Will find this and figure it out so that they don't have to go for forty two years, without having a really great workflow.
