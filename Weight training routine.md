I don't care about anything but improved power, which means as few reps as I can go. I also am only interested in doing  [half squats](Cycling/Half-squats%20are%20single%20best%20strength%20weight%20exercise.md) balancing leg curls instead of a bunch of different leg things. There are tons of studies that show only half squats are needed for cycling power.

- 15 minutes gradually increasing difficulty on stationary gym bike
- 10 reps with just the bar (20 lbs) focusing on form
- Half-squats for raw power (working toward 3x3 days/sets/reps)
- Leg curls for muscular balance, not power (5x5)
- 5 minutes comfortably high cadence to get legs back
- eat 10-25g of protein within three hours (2 boiled eggs, 300ml milk, etc.)

Weight should be 80-90% of 1RPM and always leave 1-2 reps "in the tank" (don't go until full exhaustion) in order to preserve muscle function and recover for riding.
