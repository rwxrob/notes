This is a summary of what I wear to ride my bikes. This helps me make sure I didn't lose anything in the wash and can create a list quickly when going on any sort of trip. It might help others to find the right stuff for them. Cycling apparel can get really expensive—unnecessarily. For me, a few really good items makes all the difference, compared to getting the absolute wrong clothes for the job.

I have enough clothes to get me through one week of 22 hours of training before I need to wash it all for the next week.

I absolutely hate tight-fitting Spandex cycling apparel. I'm sorry, even the most fit amazing cyclists look absolutely ridiculous. NO ONE looks good in it—especially the MAMILs who stuff their 20% body fat stuffed into it. Women can pull it off more easily than men, for sure, but still.

The only time I'll wear tight-fitting anything is when wind really matters, which is almost never. [Lycra takes off 20-70 watts](Lycra%20takes%20off%2020-70%20watts.md). It's those times when I'm tempted to spend $3000 on a carbon-fiber wheel set as well. I fight that urge way more than I would like to admit.

It is far more important to be comfortable and consistent than to be ultra aero and fast. I don't care if the spandex superheroes won't even wave to me on my regular route. Guess what, I have pretty much ever Local Legend there is at this point and two world-wide CRs at 57. Those won't-wave assholes don't put in nearly the miles and speed I do. There, I said it.

By the way, the single biggest annoyance wearing Spandex is that you cannot use the restroom while wearing it without completely undressing. This makes Spandex particularly annoying on longer endurance rides. I also can't really walk into many places without really making a scene—especially in NC.
