My Specialized Torch 2 shoes are my favorite shoes to ride in, by far. They are solid road shoes that you can walk limited distances in without the fear of falling over but I would never "bike and hike" with them. But, then again, I don't need to.

My concern about being able to bike-n-hike is completely irrelevant in the "all road" scenario. This is _not_ gravel riding (although I have sort of a "spirit of gravel" approach to any cycling). If I ever had to walk more than a block I'd call an uber (or Doris) or make sure to bring walking sandals (Zeroes) so I could just walk. The worst roads I will ever be on would be just slightly muddy or minimal gravel so I never had to do any significant walking in my cycling shoes. Best shoes for the job. 
The power distribution is so nice and keeps my feet from ever getting numb since all the power is distributed over such a wider area than any SPD cleat ever could. Although road cleats are super stiff they are remarkably comfortable to walk into a bookstore for coffee, or a restaurant to get a burrito. They have a huge pad for the heel so not afraid of grinding it away.  Plus my shoes are black so they look pretty normal when I have socks and overshorts on.



I cannot believe I was so conflicted amount running gravel shoes versus these. Even on my epic long ride days I'm super confident in this decision.
