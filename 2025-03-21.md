Yesterday's ride started at 25C and dropped to 13 by the end with 30kph winds _on average_. It was brutal. I started in thermal tights and went back and changed to bibs because they were too hot. Boy did I regret that. Here's what I learned:

- 2 550 ml water bottles with two scoops electrolyte each was perfect
- Only ate about a dozen gummies total for the ride and was strong whole way
- Sips were a bit too big every 15 minutes making me want to pee before the end
- Winds blew me around like a leaf making me rethink deep rim aero wheels
- Putting off high-end deep rim wheels until at least 2026
- Realized I really do need to get into the gym to up my power
- Saw a Strava dude pushing 250 for two hours and only getting 45 TSS (that would kill me)
-
