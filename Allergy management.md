One very serious health condition I have is random allergies to just about everything. Right now my beard itches, my scalp itches, my stomach is so bloated it's distended, and I *really* hungry and unable to sleep. Here's the thing, yes there's a lot of pollen around but this isn't that. Endurance sports somehow reduce them all making me able to eat things I normally can't, like cereal with lactose free milk, but not today. Today I just lifted weights and didn't do endurance and I'm having a serious allergy attack like I used to have. So this is my list of foods I'm pretty sure cause me problems:

- Milk even without lactose
- Salted Nut Rolls
- Tootsie rolls (ate a few from gym)

Foods that are my staples:

- Plain waffles but specifically *only* [Millville Buttermilk brand from Aldis](https://a.co/d/6F6P1Bn)
- Two hard boiled eggs with pap
