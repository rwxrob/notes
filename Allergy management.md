One very serious health condition I have is random allergies to just about everything. Right now my beard itches, my scalp itches, my stomach is so bloated it's distended, and I *really* hungry and unable to sleep. Here's the thing, yes there's a lot of pollen around but this isn't that. Endurance sports somehow reduce them all making me able to eat things I normally can't, like cereal with lactose free milk, but not today. Today I just lifted weights and didn't do endurance and I'm having a serious allergy attack like I used to have. So this is my list of foods I'm pretty sure cause me problems. Some of these cause itching, others cause intestinal distress, some cause both.

- Milk even without lactose
- Salted Nut Rolls
- Peanuts (which also keep me up at night)
- Tootsie rolls (ate a few from gym)
- Most any beans
- Pasta, even gluten free
- Red meat unless ground up
- Cashews

Foods that are my staples:

- Plain waffles but specifically *only* [Millville Buttermilk brand from Aldis](https://a.co/d/6F6P1Bn)
- Two hard boiled eggs with paprika and salt and a little mayo (three is too much)
- Huel Black Chocolate, which took me a while to adapt to but am now really okay with
- Popcorn with olive oil
- Any white rice (but not brown for some reason)
- Marinara sauce
- Lentils of any kind
- Camebert cheese
- Goat cheese
- Parmasan cheese
- Ice cream
- Pretty much any raw fruit or vegetable

This makes being an endurance athlete very difficult since gut training is such a huge part of it.
