The Cheaha challenge is the only GFNat "partner" event that includes the overall start-to-finish time in the calculation of final GFNAT points. In fact, there is only a single timed segment (3-mile climb) on the whole 84 mile route for my age group. That just sucks. This defeats the main attraction of the GFNat series in the first place. The entire point of timed-segment events is to promote casual fun at the rest stops and camaraderie while allowing serious competition during the timed segmentsâ€”especially wha

There are also several other reasons I won't be doing Cheaha ever again:

- Forcing 55-59 UCI to do the Medio instead of the Gran
- Serious descents for miles on roads sharing regular tourist traffic
- Slow climbers and 6% grade descenders on *the same open roads*
- Prohibited "packs" during ride because open roads
- History of serious accidents
- Sink hole in road took out most of Ultra route in 2025
- Absolutely horrible road quality for an event of this size
- No jersey included in $200 entry fee
- Absolutely stupid jersey designs
- It's just really, really hate Alabama
- Detours to allow "construction of hotel" in a State Park
