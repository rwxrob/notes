Reading a lot about osmolality this beautiful Sunday recovery morning. I know. I'm obsessed. Turns out that I probably went just over the isotonic limit yesterday on the second loop by adding just a bit too much light corn syrup (pure glucose) to my sugar-free, affordable electrolyte drink (Key Nutrients Electrolyte Powder). To my credit, this is incredibly complicated to get right and vastly misunderstood. It's the reason thinking about what I put into my body on a given day for given effort is every bit as important as all the physical training I have done. People people hate thinking about nutrition and hydration. They consider it a bother. They'd rather suffer through an extra leg day that get nutrition right, let alone actually understand what osmolality means. "I just want to ride!" For those who _do_ care, I am going to share my findings.

As a reminder, when you cross the isotonic limit—where the stuff in your gut is _more_ concentrated than your blood—you start _pulling_ water out of you gut leading to dehydration instead of putting it in. This is bad, very bad. It's the reason most people are better off going with a prepared performance drink mix but don't stop reading thinking that is enough. The best drink mix in the world still doesn't save you from going hypertonic by eating the wrong things in the wrong amounts while attempting to hydrate as well.

What do I mean? Let's take some typical examples.

Gels are notoriously hypertonic when people don't drink an entire water bottle with them to keep the resulting combination of things in the gut _less_ concentrated than the blood leading to dehydration, sloshing, GI cramps, and diarrhea in extreme cases. Gels are also ridiculously over priced. Most are the equivalent of light-corn syrup and a caffeine pill with some fructose thrown in as well (fructose and glucose have two different digestion pathways, glucose is direct, fructose has to be processed).

Chews and gummy bears and almost pure glucose which gets absorbed immediately and directly into the blood stream as early as in the mouth. Want to force a sugar crash? Eat too many of these at once. What's worse is that if you eat too many you might also change the isotonic balance of the stuff in your guy to hypertonic. Sure your fluid balance of sodium and carb to water might be perfect to match just under the concentration of your blood but by eating those few gummies at the wrong time you just prevented all of that last fluid taken in from hydrating you at all. The good news is that chews and gummies in the right amounts are the fastest to vacate your gut because of their direct absorption  making that next sip of hydration fluid more likely to actually work.

Carbs are substantially more concentrated than sodium even though both contribute to osmolality. For example, I could triple my scoops of electrolyte powder if only water in the bottles, which I might need to do on a very hot or high-competitive day when I'm sweating like crazy. In such cases I would keep carb intake entirely separate (probably gummies since they are the fastest to absorb) and trickle in carbs intermittently with hydration sips training on long rides to get the timing just right.

This is why heat and humidity are such a _huge_ performance factors. They radically change the key performance nutrition possibilities just by forcing so much more sweat. By the way, when your skin is wet and your body is still hot your body thinks it needs to pump out even more sweat dehydrating you even faster. This is why sweating out at any temperature is so dangerous—without even including the risk of hypothermia. "Just drink more" doesn't nearly cover the complexity of what your body needs to perform even at a basic level.

This is why even though I _could_ have completely my bike trip last Summer in 136F weather last year it likely would have come close to killing me because it is impossible to both take in the level of carbs needed to fuel that effort _and_ take in enough water. I almost did it because it is "a dry heat" meaning my sweat actually does something (compared to same temps in NC). Even a minimally hot day makes fueling and hydration much, much harder. I likely would have went hypertonic and died of heat stroke (like so many others did that year from far less strenuous activities). "They should have brought more water" is a shallow, uneducated opinion about what actually happened to them. I'm glad I heeded the warnings from the national weather service even though I lost hundreds of dollars.

So what should I actually eat and drink and how?

For me I feel more comfortable ensuring I've got a little wiggle room

really push it while sodium does not nearly as much. I could also use more water in the process and have read a lot of other non-pro cyclists who use 750ml bottles all the time just because they don't have have a soigneur. Chloe, my AI, is the closest thing I have, but she cannot
