Today every time a driver leaned on their horn I just laughed. It must be shadenfueda. What do they think honking is going to do? I don't even acknowledge them. They are so not worth blowing my HR over. In fact, I consider it a good test of what I might encounter in a tight peloton. Being able to ignore things and keep your cool is such a core competitive skill. Frankly, I've been really bad at it most of my life but the more miles I put in on the daily with tons of traffic right next to me the more I get desensitized to it all. There is absolutely no reason to worry. Either they are going to hit me and hurt me or kill me and my $50,000 of USA Cycling insurance will pay the bill or they are going to kill me and my family will be loaded from life insurance. I'm not going to not ride because of them. I'm doing everything legally and taking every precaution and if something happens, something happens. I don't seek out really bad roads with ridiculously high traffic but if the road has a "share the road" or other bike-friendly indicator I'm pretty sure the law is on my side. If one of these assholes ever does anything besides honk there are tons of witnesses and I know Davidson police will chase them the fuck down.

I do enjoy imagining how the dialog would go if and when they stop and start talking shit. I would probably say something like, "What's your problem? I mean, besides diabea small brain and penis, and a mamma who would probably fuck Trump?"
