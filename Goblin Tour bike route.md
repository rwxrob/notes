Goblin Tour is a safe, scenic version of longer and faster Goblin Road with greenways and paths instead of most roads. It makes a great endurance or recovery ride or even trekking with family and friends. It includes several points of interest along the way to keep things fun and casual. Birkdale Village is probably the biggest attraction with plenty of eating, coffee, beer, concerts, and shopping. Since this route is a loop many will want to start and end at Birkdale instead of the official start and stop point in Davidson. The route is 40k so four loops makes a century.

There is no gravel and the route can be easily ridden with a full road bike although gravel-ish tires with a little tread might better handle seasonal wet leaves, occasional flooding, and dodging frogs. 

The route crosses highway 77 twice, once using a very scenic underground tunnel and another using the best pedestrian/biker bridge available.
