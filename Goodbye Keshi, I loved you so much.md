As I hung Keshi up on what would be her new home on a hook inside of my new bike shed she started to bleed and I started to cry. 

My wife says it takes nothing to make me cry. And that i'm just too big of a softy about everything. she's probably right. As I looked over her frame and looked at all the dings each with a memory and realize it's really time for me to let her go the donator her to somebody who needs her more than I do.

We've done so much together. She was with me during the crash when I lost my teeth. I know it's completely silly to anthropomorthize these things, but here's the deal: she's *real* to me.  I shared so many hopes and dreams and challenges and failures with keshi. But it's time for us to move on. It's time for *me* to move on. 

I could barely see through the tears as I took off the quad locks and the light mounts and the seat and the garmen pedals. It was hard not to imagine her talking to me, knowing that this was the time for her to go. i realize this sounds completely stupid to most people.I don't give a shit. i loved her. i love her still. 

maybe a homeless person or someone will find her in a thrift shop. she's the perfect bike to take a lot of weight.For somebody who brings their entire home with them on two wheels. god knows I tried. the only way I can get through this is imagining her with somebody else who will appreciate her
