I watched a video with a bunch of bike messengers more into the vibe and their look that anything. I had to chuckle. We all get that way.

One guy was showing off the weight of his minimal titanium bike that he had to drill holes into for a water bottle cage and felt the need to justify. It had gorgeous deep-rim aero wheels. Then he raced with a five pound Kryptonite bike lock for now reason in an Ally Cat. The lock weighed as much as his bike.

I know that bike messengers are not into logic and scienceâ€”like at all. They are _so_ into the vibe. They wouldn't ride a fixie with no brakes and no helmet in the middle of New York if there were even a modicum of logic and good sense in their brains. Riding the world's most aero and light bicycle

I get that people are into the art of it, but sometimes form supplants function and you just look stupid. The same could be said of seriously overweight people stuffing themselves into skintight spandex. Why? It isn't the aero drag that is slowing you down buddy.

Now I have a confession to make. Will I wear a wind flapping western style gravel shirt that costs as much as three standard bike jerseys while riding my aluminum bike with $2000 carbon deep rim aero wheels? Hell yes!
