I just noticed that while I was writing some stuff by speaking and having it converted to text that it was automatically publishing to get up just because it was synchronizing in real time to the content in my running obsidian application on my laptop. i had already noticed the amazing fact that I don't have to save anything. It automatically gets saved and synchronized between them. when they get up, synchronization, plug and fired off and sent a notification.I was blown away. all I have to do is leave my laptop on and plugged in and everything that I take notes about on my phone will automatically get pushed to GitHub.
