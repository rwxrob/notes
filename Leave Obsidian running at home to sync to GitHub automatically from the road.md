I just noticed that while I was writing some stuff by speaking and having it converted to text that it was automatically publishing to get up just because it was synchronizing in real time to the content in my running obsidian application on my laptop. i had already noticed the amazing fact that I don't have to save anything. It automatically gets saved and synchronized between them. when they get up, synchronization, plug and fired off and sent a notification.I was blown away. all I have to do is leave my laptop on and plugged in and everything that I take notes about on my phone will automatically get pushed to GitHub.

What makes this so completely awesome?Is the absolute simplicity of the whole thing. the only thing I have to do to take a note is open the obsidian app on my phone and just start talking to it into a new note. if I already have a running note, open about a particular trip, I can just switch to the obsidian app and start talking. that's it. there's no button surprise.There's nothing except for switching to the app so that it's on. all the rest is automated all the way up to GitHub. there is literally nothing I could ever do to make the process of taking notes simpler.
