Great Saturday started with coffee and conversation with Doris. The weather was amazing. It pulled me outside almost immediately for 100k bike ride. I bought water for family then I just collapsed and had a great nap afterward. Perfect Saturday.
## The simple life

I'm really loving the simple life these days: sleep, eat, work, ride. Everything seems to be getting a lot better, my health, my skills both at work and at play, my money situation, my relationship with my wife and kids, and my outlook and happiness. I know that world is pretty much on fire right now, but I feel remarkably fine about it. It's someplace in between not caring and realizing there's only so much I can do.
## Crushed a KOM

Back from a crushing a double Goblin Road today (100k total). Managed a worldwide KOM on a segment that 230 others have ridden. At 57 that makes me feel good. It wasn't easy. I all-out sprinted to get it and dawned the lycra super hero outfit. Since realizing that lycra saves 20-70 watts depending on the speed I'm not afraid to stuff my fat beer belly into it once in a while to get a KOM or two. Turns out it worked today.

##  Not feeling like livestreaming

I go through these phases all the time, periods where I just don't want to wear and turn on that camera for livestreaming. I just want to be by myself, me and nature and the people immediately around me. Lately I've been hit with this feeling pretty strongly.

It started when I was running late for a daily bike training ride and just didn't want to hassle with the stream so I just went out on the ride. I ended up crushing several of my PRs and placing third on one KOM segment. Today I took the 1st place on that same segment. This is only reinforcing my desire to not lug that camera around.

The camera pack is really dialed in, but it is extremely uncomfortable to wear in aero position on the bike. The upper body weight does something funky to my back and I can feel it in my vertebrae. It's not good. I'm also not to keen on the idea of beaming three high-powered mobile hotspot modems through my torso every day.

Then there is the whole "what the hell is he wearing" reactions I get from people when I have the camera on. It's even worse if I put on the lycra as well. I have been in some pelotons where they don't mind, but on the whole people really hate me having a camera around all the time. I've noticed people are much more likely to just talk to me on the ride or wave without the camera, which makes sense.

Facebook just announced 30 day old live videos will automatically be deleted. So much for historical vods. Hopefully YouTube will keep them around. But not having a 5 hour video and just clips from a camera instead or a few photos is always more sustainable.

Really connected with the scenery in ways I had forgotten about. The camera has me looking at the phone all the time and not really being present. This is not only dangerous, it's much less fulfilling. The very attraction of endurance sports as meditation is thwarted completely by livestreaming. Dropping the camera made that euphorically evident these last few days.

Livestreaming costs me currently $200/month. That's $2400 per year, the cost of my road bike, or the cost of a high-end wheel-set. Is what I'm getting with livestreaming worth _not_ getting a new wheel-set? ***Hell, no.***

Loneliness motivates me to make in-person connections with new people, join meetups and group rides instead of depend on my livestream community for that. I love them a lot, but they continually prove that they will never be people I can actually hang out on a bike ride IRL. That's not that they are bad people, it's just they are different people. By not livestreaming I find myself meeting more people who share the same hobbies and interests as I do and as much as I legitimately love the people I've come to know through livestreaming, I want more. I want friends I can actually _do_ things with IRL.
