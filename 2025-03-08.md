## Crushed a KOM

Back from a crushing a double Goblin Road today (100k total). Managed a worldwide KOM on a segment that 230 others have ridden. At 57 that makes me feel good. It wasn't easy. I all-out sprinted to get it and dawned the lycra super hero outfit. Since realizing that lycra saves 20-70 watts depending on the speed I'm not afraid to stuff my fat beer belly into it once in a while to get a KOM or two. Turns out it worked today.
