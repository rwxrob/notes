## Crushed a KOM

Back from a crushing a double Goblin Road today (100k total). Managed a worldwide KOM on a segment that 230 others have ridden. At 57 that makes me feel good. It wasn't easy. I all-out sprinted to get it and dawned the lycra super hero outfit.

Then there is the whole "what the hell is he wearing" reactions I get from people when I have the camera on. It's even worse if I put on the lycra as
