Just sitting in my bike shed hearing the wind and birds around me makes a ton of difference in my perspective. Lately, I've been reminded of what it is all about.

It's not what have I done for humanity. 

It's not how I will be remembered.

It's not about  heaven or hell.

It's not even the relationships I've made including my family.

It's what am I doing in this exact moment. How aware am I of everything that is happening simultaneously. 

Thoughtful, mindful, present, aware, awake, connected. There are many labels for it. The real question is can I detach myself from the FOOMO, fear of others missing out on the amazing experiences I have had and have every single day. I want that for everyone but it is out of my control.

All I can control is my own focus and peace right now even if the impermenace of that moment and all it's exquisite joy is blown away by the winds of time like a Bhuddist mandala made out of colorful sand. 

I am never alone. I have all around me to keep me company. I do feel sad for those who never figure this out but it is not my place to show them the way. This has to be sought and discovered. All I can do is contiue to seek the things I have yet to discover that only I can discover for myself.
