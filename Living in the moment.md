Just sitting in my bike shed hearing the wind and birds around me makes a ton of difference in my perspective. Lately, I've been reminded of what it is all about.

It's not about what I own (obviously, you'd have to be a fucking moron to think it is).

It's not about what have I done for humanity. 

It's not how I will be remembered.

It's not about heaven or hell.

It's not even about the relationships I've madeâ€”including my family.

It's about now, right now, what am I doing in this exact moment, am I present, how aware am I of everything that is happening simultaneously. 

Thoughtful, mindful, present, aware, awake, connected. There are many labels. The real question is can I detach myself from the FOOMO (fear of others missing out ). I get terrified that others will never experience the joy I'm feeling at any given moment. I feel duty bound to make sure *they know* how to be happy. Sure I have tons of bad days, but ironically it is the good ones that cause me the most stress. "Is anyone else feeling this? How can I help them to feel it?" 

Sadly, helping anyone find joy is largely out of my control. No matter how "busy" I get to improve the world, the world has to want to be improved. Let's face it. Getting most people to care at all about the stuff I care about is a complete exercise in futility. I can't influence anyone, and frankly, those who *do* influence are almost always charlatans who haven't experienced anything significant in the first place. The best "influencers" are those you encounter in every day life who aren't posting to social media, who are just living. People find them and are influenced by them, not the other way around. The masses of lonely, sad, confused people are 

All I can control is my own focus and peace right now even if the impermanence of any moment and all it's exquisite joy is blown away by the winds of time like a Buddist mandala made of colorful sand. 

I am never alone. I have everything around me to keep me company. I do feel sad for those who never figure this out but it is not my place to show them the way. This has to be sought and discovered. All I can do is continue to seek the things I have yet to discover that only I can discover for myself.
