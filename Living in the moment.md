Just sitting in my bike shed hearing the wind and birds around me makes a ton of difference in my perspective. Lately, I've been reminded of what it is all about.

It's not what have I done for humanity. 

It's not how I will be remembered.

It's not about  heaven or hell.

It's not even about the relationships I've madeâ€”including my family.

It's about now, right now, what am I doing in this exact moment; how aware am I of everything that is happening simultaneously. 

Thoughtful, mindful, present, aware, awake, connected. There are many labels for it. The real question is can I detach myself from the FOOMO (fear of others missing out ). I get terrified that others will never experience the joy I'm feeling at any given moment. Sure I have tons of bad days, but its the good ones that cause be the most stress. 

"Is anyone else feeling this? How can I help them to feel it?" 

When I have those moments of utter bliss I want it for everyone. Sadly, this is largely out of my control. No matter how "busy" I get to improve the world, the world has to want to be improved. Let's face it. Getting most people to care at all about the stuff I care about is a complete exercise in futility. I can't influence anyone, and frankly, those who *do* influence are almost always charlatans who haven't experienced anything significant in the first place. The best "influencers" are those you encounter in every day life

All I can control is my own focus and peace right now even if the impermenace of that moment and all it's exquisite joy is blown away by the winds of time like a Bhuddist mandala made out of colorful sand. 

I am never alone. I have all around me to keep me company. I do feel sad for those who never figure this out but it is not my place to show them the way. This has to be sought and discovered. All I can do is contiue to seek the things I have yet to discover that only I can discover for myself.
