Contrary to popular belief, it is _not_ from Lactic Acid. 

**1. Muscle Microtrauma (DOMS)**

• **Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness** comes from **tiny tears** in your muscle fibers from repetitive effort (especially on hills or long grinds).
• The burn is partly due to the **inflammation** that follows, not just the effort itself.

**2. Hydrogen Ion Accumulation (during ride)**

• At higher intensities, your body produces **hydrogen ions** alongside lactate, which **lowers pH** in the muscle and creates that **acidic, burning sensation**.
• It’s **not lactate** itself causing the burn—lactate actually buffers fatigue!

**3. Glycogen Depletion**

• Long rides deplete your muscle’s stored carbs (glycogen), which also hold water. When they’re gone, you feel **flat**, and your legs start to **burn under load**.
• This is part of the reason you might feel like you’re pedaling through cement near the end of a century ride.

**4. Electrolyte Imbalance**

• **Low sodium, potassium, magnesium** after sweating a lot can impair nerve signaling, causing **cramps** or a deep muscle ache that feels like burning.

**5. Inflammatory Metabolites**

• Repeated muscle contractions lead to a buildup of **pro-inflammatory chemicals** like prostaglandins and cytokines that irritate nerve endings → **burning or aching pain** after the ride.
