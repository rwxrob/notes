Called "callouts" in Obsidian, GFM renders the following annotations that are supported in both Obsidian and MkDocs.

```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> This is a note
```

Looks like all the following are supported:

- NOTE
- TIP
- INFO
- WARNING
- IMPORTANT

Here are samples of each to check that it still works:

>[!NOTE]
>This is a note.
