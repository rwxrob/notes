Called "callouts" in Obsidian, GFM renders the following annotations that are supported in both Obsidian and MkDocs.

```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> This is a note
```

Looks like all the following are supported:

- NOTE
- TIP
- WARNING
- IMPORTANT

It appears labels and collapsing them and INFO are not supported on GitHub.

Here are samples of each to check that it still works:

>[!NOTE]
>This is a note.

>[!TIP]
>This is a tip.

>[!WARNING]
>This is a warning.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This is important.
