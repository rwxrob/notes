Obsidian is a great tool but unfortunately the defaults are not compatible with GitHub Flavored Markdown and browsing from GitHub. By following these basic conventions Obsidian notes become 100% compatible:

* Keep all your notes in a single vault on GitHub
* Include only a single base `README.md`
* Add legal info and disclaimer to `README.md` describing raw note nature of repo
* Publish content _from_ notes into polished books or blog posts
* Follow the **_one idea_** principle from Zettelkasten
* Abandon other outdated ideas from Zettelkasten
* Allow spaces in file names so titles and graphs are readable
* [Choose unique, descriptive titles in sentence case](Choose%20unique,%20descriptive%20titles%20in%20sentence%20case.md)
* [Don't worry about slugs If needed create on export](Don't%20worry%20about%20slugs%20If%20needed%20create%20on%20export.md)
* Setup automated sync using Git and GitHub on all devices
* Change default to use standard relative Markdown links internally
* Don't use anything that isn't GitHub Flavored Markdown supported
* [Disable default automatic hard line breaks](Disable%20default%20automatic%20hard%20line%20breaks.md)
* Only publish raw vault on GitHub
* Keep everything flat since GitHub links do not work with subfolders
* Never end bulleted list items with period so entire line can become new note
* [Keep paragraphs free from hyperlinks](Keep%20paragraphs%20free%20from%20hyperlinks.md)
