Since discovering Dustin Klein and hearing him use the "adventure cycling" term in a way that most cyclists don't to refer to high-performance, usually epic day or overnight rides, I feel like adding "performance" to it makes sense. To me this rules out the long-haul, ultra slow bike touring that has been rebranded as "adventure cycling" and is more inclusive than "gravel riding" which often infers that there is no mountain bike involved. The term "adventure cycling" has also been widely adopted by people as an alternative term to "bike packing" and, let's face it, bike tourists have been calling themselves "adventure cyclists" now as well. 

Hence my reason for really liking the term "performance adventure cycling" which could include minimal fastpack bikepacking that I do hope to perfect over the coming year. In fact, I have decided to use NC Mountains to Coast to really dial in my edge season fastpacking rig (seat bag, bento, top-tube bag, hip pack, bivy, ultralight sleep kit,  etc.)
