I'm reminded today that I'm primarily a roadieâ€”specifically an all-roadie because I'm addicted to cruising speed, averaging between 25 and 30 kph through safe, scenic landscapes of all kinds. This speed is perfect to get that feeling of floating over the landscape. It's hypnotizing, meditative. A lot of other solo all-roadies also agree.



Keeping a cruising speed pace on an unencumbered, aero road bike usually means I'm also swimming in good drugs (endorphins, dopamine, and serotonin) and I'm _definitely_ addicted to those.

Today on my ride I realized I'm really just want a motorcycle without the motor where I _am_ the motor. I just love sensation of speed be it on pristine tarmac or perfectly paved MTB trails with lots of flow and twists. Feeling the wind on those 50-60kph descents and knowing I'm safe on my new Domane on suburban streets is what I would consider nearly perfection. The equivalent off road is also appealing, which is why I got a HTC trail bike as well.
