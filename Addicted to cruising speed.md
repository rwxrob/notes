I'm reminded today that I'm primarily a roadieâ€”specifically an all-roadie because I'm addicted to cruising speed, averaging between 25 and 30 kph through safe, scenic landscapes of all kinds. This speed is perfect to get that feeling of floating over the landscape. It's hypnotizing, meditative. Other all-roadies agree.

## Motorcyclist without the motor

I think I get the appeal of ebiking more. It gives cruising speed junkies what they want without the work. The sensation is much like being on a scooter or motorcycling, both things I also love because they work at cruising speed. The feeling of wind pushing back against you is key. There's something wonderful and horrible about it.
## Maybe its the good drugs

Having a motor do all the work robs cruis
Keeping a cruising speed pace on an unencumbered, aero road bike usually means I'm also swimming in good drugs (endorphins, dopamine, and serotonin) and I'm _definitely_ addicted to those.
