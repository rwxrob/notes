I am a former skater, wannabe bike messenger,  former crit racer and triathlete with a gravel spirit at heart. This means I prefer most riding on the road geeking out about performance and fitness while trying not to *look like* I'm geeking out about KOMs and performance. I absolutely hate the look of lycra but will put it on occasionally to save those watts.

I do like my mountain bike for trail riding but only if it has flow and could basically be ridden on a gravel bike. Honestly, I absolutely despise rocks and roots. They are not fun—ever, not because I can't do them, because they just suck. Some people will call me a "pussy" for saying that and I'll just quietly think they are fucking morons. Jumps are fun. The occasional drop is fun (so long as you don't risk breaking you back on it, like so many pros are discovering). I could see how berms could be fun.

More than anything I love the *culture* of gravel riding, the "bring a beer in your water bottle holder" thing. And clothing preferences that sit nicely between the MTB hardcore we-don't-do-lycra ethos and the lycra or die roadies who find their way off road eventually (like Lachlan Morton). Most of us really don't need a few seconds of aerodynamic advantage—especially when we are even a kilo over weight. I want comfort and the ability to walk into a pub without scarring everyone. 

However, I also want very high-performing power output from my pedals and gearing and frankly hate being bounced to death by gravel. So I run road pedals unless I am going to be sure to do a lot of walking around, then I just change the pedals (and one day might actually have a different bike for that). 

For me gravel and trails are a means to an end: to ride in *zero traffic*, to get as close to Zwift in the real world as possible where the roads are dedicated to cyclists.
