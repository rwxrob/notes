One thing 40 years of cycling has taught me is that racing is never fair. There are always those who have the cheapest equipment and those with pro gear and fully support teams. We won't even talk about all the methods to cheat. Esports might not be able to do anything about the cheaters but it does level the playing field completely when it comes to pay-to-win disparities. I absolutely love that. Sure people will have bikes that register more power than others and shoes that transfer power better, but on the whole this disparity is a fraction of that in the real world of bike racing across the board.

Esports racing also removes the peloton bullies completely. There's no Mark Cavendish employing people completely off the course to get the lead. It might be more boring to watch, but esport cycling removes that behavior entirely. You can't even talk shit to those you are competing against in a way that everyone cannot also see. I've heard some of the worst examples of human behavior ever said within a "pro" peloton. Nope. Not any more. Esports completely shuts that down. Show me the watts, asshole.
