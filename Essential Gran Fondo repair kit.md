After reading a lot about it I decided carrying an ultra minimal repair kit on my Gran Fondo—even though they are supported—is worth the savings it will provide in time. Plus getting into the habit of carrying the essentials will make daily rides easier. I used to always carry a kit including a full foldable tire replacement when I commuted daily. But I don't think I need that much. I just need enough to limp home and if all else fails I'll call an Uber or get the "ride anywhere" coverage Garmin is now offering. I'm never riding anywhere on my road bike that is not near help if needed.

- [Continental TPU Tube ](https://a.co/d/eVs59AI) (same shipped with Swiss Side wheel set)
- [Topeak Mini 9 multi tool (no need for chain stuff)](https://a.co/d/30ckrGy)

I can swap out the Mini 9 for my much heavier Crankbros for gravel rides where chain might be at risk, but honestly, I don't plan on riding in many of those events if at all. I mean, if I have road shoes on I'm not on anything but ultra light gravel.
