Today I was reminded why power meters are actually good and why FTP really does matter. They are the  best thing mere mortals have to attempt to get anywhere near determining lactate threshold 2, the point at which the body can no longer clear lactic acid from the body.

In the 90s we used to use Promax so that we couldn't feel lactate when it built up and keep pushing hard. That was stupid. 

Norwegian endurance training, especially in **cycling, running, and cross-country skiing**, is **heavily focused on lactate measurement** to optimize training intensity. This method is backed by research and used by elite athletes like **Jakob Ingebrigtsen (running) and Kristian Blummenfelt (triathlon)**.

Peter Attia and Inigo San Mill√°n have talked about this a lot in their explanation of why zone 2 training is important. They both admit that FTP is inferior to proper lactate threshold training but it is all we have. Eventually, there will ba a way to measure lactate directly in the
