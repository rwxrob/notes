Listen, I'm not cool. I don't have "a vibe." I'm a dad making dad jokes all day married to the female version of the same thing. My wife actually says "that's what she said" to everything. If I have any cool in me at all it's the Ryan Reynolds "would you please just shut up" type which is why a note like this gets the very uncool title "What do I want out of life?"

The answer is pretty simple actually:

- Time with those I *truly* love (and who love me)
- To know those I love are safe, secure, and happy
- To be exceptionally fit and healthy
- To be able to see as much of this world as I can
- To create whatever brings me joy

That's it. Notice there is nothing there about meeting new people. On the whole, I hate people. A few are worth knowing and hanging out with, even emulating. The rest are absolute shit that bring me nothing but pain and suffering and stress. The percentage of human beings that I actually _want_ to hang out with—or even talk to, for that matter—is excruciatingly small. My wife has always felt the same even though she isn't as public about it. A well-curated group of elite friends is _always_ better than any group of people you are forced to be with—even better than the family you were born into. There I said what no one will. The idea that Mormons used to teach me about "being together forever" with the family I was forced to live in mortifies me to the point where if I actually thought that was really true I would kill myself just to go to hell to avoid it.
