Listen, I'm not cool. I don't have "a vibe." I'm a dad with grown adult children still making dad jokes married to the female version of the same thing. My wife actually says "that's what she said" to everything. If I have any cool in me at all it's the Ryan Reynolds "would you please just shut up" type which is why a note like this gets the very uncool title "What do I want out of life?"

The answer is pretty simple actually:

- Time with those I *truly* love (and who love me)
- To know those I love are safe, secure, and happy
- To be exceptionally fit and healthy
- To be able to experience as much of this world as I can
- To create whatever brings me joy

That's it. 

Notice there is nothing about meeting new people. On the whole, I hate people. Most humans bring nothing but ignorance, pain, suffering and stress into my life. The percentage of human beings that I actually _want_ to hang out with—or even talk to, for that matter—is tiny. My wife has always felt the same.  A well-curated group of elite friends is _always_ better than any group of people forced on me—although occasionally I will discover a gem among them. Some people will call this type of thinking "elitist" to which I say, "fine, now go away."
