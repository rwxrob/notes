Listen, I'm not cool. I don't have "a vibe." I'm a dad making dad jokes all day married to the female version of the same thing. My wife actually says "that's what she said" to everything. If I have any cool in me at all it's the Ryan Reynolds "would you please just shut up" type which is why a note like this gets the very uncool title "What do I want out of life?"

The answer is pretty simple actually:

- Time with those I *truly* love (and who love me)
- To know those I love are safe, secure, and happy
- To be exceptionally fit and healthy
- To be able to see as much of this world as I can
- To create whatever brings me joy

That's it. Notice there is nothing there about meeting new people. On the whole, I hate people. A few are worth knowing and hanging out with, even emulating. The rest are absolute shit that bring nothing but pain and suffering and stress. The percentage of human beings that I actually _want_ to hang out with—or even talk to, for that matter—is excruciatingly small. My wife has always felt the same even though she isn't as public about it. 

A well-curated group of elite friends I look up to is _always_ better than any group of people you are forced to be with—even better than the family you were born into.
