Speaking of wheel-sets. I've noticed that most age-groupers and club riders—even those who seem to have a lot of money to burn—don't see to upgrade their wheels. Most just buy the highest end bike in the place and keep the wheels it has. It takes a true connoisseur to recognize the value of a cheaper frame with a best-of-breed wheel-set like the Roval CLX II line. In other words, my top-of-the-low-end $2000 Domane AL with a $3000 wheel-set will almost always dominate over a stock "high end" bike that most rich casuals usually buy.

The all-around Roval Rapide CLX II is 1520g compared to 1265g for Alpinist CLX II, 255g difference).

It's not worth the cost. Besides putting that savings into better wheels will go a lot farther toward speed increases.
