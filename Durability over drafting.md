I fucking hate drafting. I always have. It's the reason international triathlons are such a fucking joke. Someone can be a strong swimmer and have their lead obliterated by sucking off the wheel of the pack in the bike leg that follows. International triathlons are just so broken. They really shouldn't even be allowed.

It's no surprise, then, to release, again, that the only competition I value is who can outlast and go faster than the other person. That's what attracted me to triathlon even though I *detest* the stupid shit we have to wear for it to be competitive. Perhaps that's why I'm really gravitating toward [performance adventure cycling](Fitness/Performance%20adventure%20cycling%20FTW.md) and ultra events like Bike Nonstop US. These events test your physical fitness, metal acuity, as well as mechanical and logistical skills. I'll take pushing my limits against someone else pushing theirs in this way over seeing who can suck wind best off the pack any day. Who gives a shit if someone "is attacking" and whether to "chase them down." Seriously, who gives. A. Shit. I certainly don't and never have.
