Any who is actually into the enjoyment of pushing themselves or the thrill of movement on the bike is going to hate it, like me. Dustin Klein seems to understand this.

The only people I know who actually enjoy bikepacking are those who take fishing poles and get to some areas that they could not really get to easily without their mountain bikes or hiking. For them bikepacking makes sense since the bike is just a way to get there.

I'm really angry with myself for realizing this far too late. I spend well over $3000 on different camping, bikepacking bags, a trailer and tech gear to come up with the perfect "digital nomad by bike." Some people thought it was cool. Others told me I had lost my mind and was going to hate it. Turns out the later group was right. It's hard to admit but I had to realize it for myself.

It was never about the outdoor camping and lugging all that gear, or even working on the road as a "digital nomad by bike" that attracted me. It was always the riding and the scenery and the fitness with a few including the amazing restaurants like the one in Emigration Canyon.
