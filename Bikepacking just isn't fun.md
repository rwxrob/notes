The only people I know who actually enjoy bikepacking are those who take fishing poles and get to some areas that they could not really get to easily without their mountain bikes or hiking. For them bikepacking makes sense since the bike is just a way to get there.

Any who is actually into the enjoyment of pushing themselves or the thrill of movement on the bike is going to hate it, like me. Dustin Klein seems to understand this.
