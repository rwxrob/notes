I am officially registered. It only cost $625 for everything including week-long parking in Lake Lure and the $150 bus trip from Fort Fisher back to Lake Lure on the 12th (the day after the end of the event). I registered the team name RWX for anyone else who wants to do it with me.

I can't believe I didn't know about this before. This is literally the single best event I could want to do while streaming. It's not until October but I just got all the motivation I ever needed to prepare physically for this:
