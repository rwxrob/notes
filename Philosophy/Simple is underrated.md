Since returning to a life focused my family, job, and self everything has improved. Nothing—not one thing—I do these days is for anyone but these three groups of people. After living more than a month with this radical simplification of priorities I have come to realize just how high the cost of being spread out to thin has been to to my mental, physical, and financial well being. It will take me literally years to recover.

Simple is better from the start. There is absolutely zero requirement for any person on this planet to care about anyone but their family, job, and self *first*. Then if there are resources available after that they can be applied toward others. It's like the airline attendants always say, "give oxygen to yourself first before your children."

If everyone did that then the overwhelming needs of those suffering would hardly exist because caring for family and job would cover taking care of those who cannot care for themselves. The biggest civic responsibility anyone has in this life is to be responsible with their own well-being first. The antithesis of this is when a person think's they are entitled to having someone else take care of them. Obviously, there are exceptions, but those exceptions are almost always a part of a family.
