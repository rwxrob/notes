I once saw an interview with a 70-year-old who kicked ass on a century road race. I wish I could find it. I'll never forget him answering a question about him compared to everyone else his age, "It's about priorities." Whether it's about staying fit or free to enjoy your life the way you want, it always comes down to what a person _actually_ prioritizes. 

Priorities are shown by what we *do*, not say. What we document our priorities to be and what they actually are is demonstrated in our actions and how we spend our time. 

When I see a guy with a family on Strava get up at 5:30 AM to ride in circles in the cold dark to increase his base fitness before headed off to work and to support his family I see his priorities. This is a wonderful thing about Strava. "If it's not on Strava it didn't happen." The great thing about Strava is not the ability to boast, which is definitely a motivator and as fun as any video game, but to demonstrate what are priorities are and reward others who share those priorities. This is why I think even amateurs should post to Strava.

I obviously still prioritized my family, but commuting 20 miles to work and 20 miles back every single day on my bike no matter what the weather demonstrated that fitness and simply getting outside was a major priority in my life. I still have memories and images indelibly frozen into my psyche from experiences I had during those rides.

I find that recently, as I return to my cycling fitness roots, I'm having the same personal experiences all over again but in new and exciting ways.
