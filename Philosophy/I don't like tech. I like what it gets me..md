I've explained why I don't live for tech a lot on live streams, why I don't constantly dump hours into streaming about tech topics, but it bears repeating. Technology is fundamentally about building and learning tools with which to build and maintain other things that are essential and bring joy. Learning Linux and coding might be fun for a while but ultimately they lose their appeal on their own if the result of using them isn't something I value.

Being able to create any kind of system or software that I want for myself is extremely satisfying and motivating. One good example of all this is how my knowledge of various technologies has helped me maintain my IRL livestreaming from anywhere in the world. Being able to contribute to these things is a huge motivator for me.

Being able to make crazy good money because of these skills and never have to worry about a job is also very motivating. I do love working with them more than some other jobs that I could be doing that make much less money. I remember staying up almost all night when I had a young family to learn the tech of the day because it allowed me eventually to work from home for more than 30 years and make a really good income.
