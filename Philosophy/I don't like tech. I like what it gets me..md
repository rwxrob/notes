I've said this a lot on live streams but it bears repeating. Learning Linux and coding might be fun for a while but ultimately they lose their appeal on their own. After all, tech is a tool and tools are used to build and maintain things. Being able to create any kind of system or software that I want for myself is extremely satisfying and motivating. Being able to make crazy good money because of these skills and never have to worry about a job is also very motivating. I do love working with them more than some other jobs that I could be doing that make much less money. But at the end of the day a tool can only provide so much satisfaction by itself. It is actually the things that we build and maintain with such tools that bring about the most joy and satisfaction.

One good example of all this is how my knowledge of various technologies has helped me maintain my IRL livestreaming from anywhere in the world. Being able to contribute to these things is a huge motivator for me.
