My Mormon grandma burned her lips off sucking on a car exhaust pipe until she died when she killed herself almost exactly one year after losing her husband, a war veteran who struggle with alcoholism after the war and sold vacuums for a time even though he was a brilliant man becoming an accountant later.

My Mormon mother would never tell that story in her "historical" journals that the obsessively keeps at the emotional and financial expense of everyone else in her household. She bitched about what a horrible father my grand father was *all the time*. I used to get so  annoyed suffering through her PTSD from being raised by those parents, a man who wasn't there to even see her born because of the war, and a mother who had to raise her and others alone.

Doris made me believe in the idea of “soul mates,” a concept I had long dismissed as something people use to justify unhealthy co-dependency. But in the end, I was only fooling myself again. Suddenly, “the Universe” seemed to want something different for us—something sparked by my inability to suppress the trauma and rage inside me. Much of that pain stemmed from her rapid rise in the local art scene, which left me effectively living a single life while still married, until I finally cracked and exploded in a way that gave everyone the excuse they needed to just move on. At best, it was a good ride while it lasted. But it didn’t last.

Nothing lasts forever—especially relationships. Everyone and everything you love right now will eventually die or disappear. The only universal truth is death and entropy. Repeat after me: I cannot depend on anyone or anything but myself. The sooner you realize that, the sooner you will start making decisions that bring you *true* happiness.

In the Ashtanga Yoga tradition this concept of non-attachment, non-possessiveness, and non-greed is called **Aparigraha** one of the five Yamas. Practicing this is a big part of achieving true peace of mind, the primary goal of Ashtanga Yoga.
