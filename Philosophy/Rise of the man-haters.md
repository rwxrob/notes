I have been a solidly respectful and decent man my whole life. Are there things in my world and psyche that I'm not even aware of? Certainly. But I have *never* been guilty of the egregious misogeny that is waved around like pictures of mutilated infants at a "pro-life" rally. Are there absolutely fucking assholes out there who are men? *Absolutely!* Am I one of them? *No.* So stop lumping me in with all of them just because you disagree with me or don't want to hear what I am feeling, or worse, don't care about my honest feelings that make you uncomfortable. Stop using misogeny as a shield for not treating me like another human who deserves basic respect.

Let me give you one example from an actual post:

>We want to give a huge shout out to ... who has done so much for ... as a friend and mentor. ... made history as the only woman ever to win ... and her dedication has been a constant inspiration for ...  Since ... she has been riding ... she chose a route about 160 kilometres longer than the one the two closest males took. 
>
>...
>
>She is hoping to win this year and show once again that women from ... are some of the toughest out there. What she is doing is nothing short of amazing and we are right here behind her every kilometre of the way.

The photo of them has the woman posting it in a bikini putting her arm around the other tired, ripped, racer.

Is this an accomplishment? Hell yeah! It should be celebrated for what it is but why does it have to be about beating "the men" and why can't it just be about the accomplishment itself. This whole obsession with gender is tired, inaccurate, and—worst of all—bigoted and exclusionary. What about trans women, for example?

I am not saying this just because, as someone might say, "she is showing up the men and you are just pissed off."  I openly admit she is, in this race. Hell, if I cared about that I would have added a comment that she is now in fourth place behind two other men, who are 1/3 and half her age. Hell, we don't even know if *any* of them are actual men. There was no genital inspection in this event. 

The point is *it is not about the gender of the person, it's about the accomplishment!* Not only do you not have to bash an entire populations of other humans to celebrate those accomplishments but you remove the distraction from the accomplishment itself.

Honestly, I am just so fucking tired of seeing this tribalism among women against men. I understand where it comes from but it isn't helping. In fact, it just makes it worse because I have never felt a stronger kinship with fellow men than right now. I understand why some men become radicalized. This sort of gender slamming just pushes us apart like any other tribal conflict. This is how some men start *wrongly* thinking someone like Andrew Tate is someone to listen to. It's bad for everyone.

And for the love of Susan B. Anthony stop saying "feminism is for men." It's not. Gender equality is. People who say shit like that are usually the first ones to create narratives that demonize all men for the rampant and horrible sins of the men who came before us. I'm not them. I'm just not. Stop grouping me with them to make yourself feel more comfortable abusing me with your rhetoric.

Most women reading this will immediately dismiss my message with, "well he just doesn't understand how hard it has been for woman in a man's world" and they would be right. But bashing and comparing accomplishments is absolutely not the way to address that problem. So many women now have the freedom to fulfill their own hopes and dreams, like men have had throughout time unfairly. This is a wonderful accomplishment for humanity. We aren't fully equal, for sure, but we'll get there. But I cannot help realizing that frankly I never want to be with a woman ever again. Even if it isn't their fault or they don't realize it, too often they look at me and other men and just don't see *me*, they see "a man." I've come to think in today's fucked up world it is impossible to be seen for anything of value and this is why so many feel lost and alone and are slapped down by other social groups for feeling that way. It is a very dangerous time for people of all genders.
