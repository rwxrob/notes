There was once a time when loosing one's temper was one of the least acceptable things a person could do. Now look at us. The more insane and morbid the content, the more clicks, views, and cash we pay. People told me they "come for the rants" which makes me sad now. Not only did I stop being a gentleman, I became "mean" and paid the consequences.

After some seriously transformative experiences recently that I'll chronicle appropriately elsewhere I have come to sincerely question how I—and so many others—have forgotten how to live like ladies and gentlemen, and why even attempting to do so is somehow derided by modern pop-culture.

There was a time when receiving a single slap with a white glove was enough to announce an insulted gentleman's intention to kill you peacefully at dawn. Now the unhinged ram vehicles into anonymous people and places they don't agree with. 

Humanity seems to have lost the civility and decorum of the past. There were many things wrong with the "good 'ol days" but the idea of behaving like a lady or gentleman was not one of them. If we are to ever become great, again. We have to relearn what becoming a gentleman even means.

Take for instance John McCain, a venerable veteran who lived through things most of us cannot even imagine without losing his cool or his honor. He stood before thousands of his chanting supporters and scolding them for deriding and disrespecting his honorable political opponent, Barak Obama. That's a gentleman. I always loved McCain but could never have supported the platform he ran on but his life, memory, and example continue to inspire me.

There's obviously a pop-culture fascination with the idea of honor even among assassins. This explains why the John Wick movies are so incredibly popular right now. It's not the killing and violence that sells that movie, it's not even the amazing stunts (okay, maybe a little) it's the glimpse into this universe where honor and respect between even the violent people is held in reverent regard. An unfailing commitment to becoming exceptionally skilled and to the honoring rules. The entire foundation of those movies is based on maintaining a civilized rule of law even among assassins.

You could say that John Wick is a gentleman assassin. This is probably why the opulent French gentleman is the bad guy. No matter how much he tries to dress himself up as a gentleman, we see his petty soul, weak personality, and the small, narcissistic intellect of a street thug. Wick may lack the loquacious vocabulary and opulent mansion but proves he is 1000 times more or a gentleman than he. Why? Because John loves and honors others above all else, even those he's required to kill and full of vengeful rage.

In Firefly,  Mal answers Simon who asks, "How do I know you won't kill me in my sleep?"

> “You don’t know me, son, so let me explain this to you once: **If I ever kill you, you’ll be awake. You’ll be facing me. And you’ll be armed.**”

Later Mal doesn't kill Atherton, a rich slime-ball he's faced to duel in the classical way but pokes him with the tip of his sword and says.

>Guess I’m just a good man.
>(then he stabs again)
>Well, I’m all right.

The world desperately needs *more* gentlemanly honor even if it remains violent. Instead, we celebrate those who confirm to no rules but their own.

So how do I become a gentleman? (God knows I have not been most of my life.)

First, I have to clean my room and become more attentive to my grooming and appearance. This might seem like an unexpected first step. I have learned from being a Mormon, a business man, a skate punk, and an Ashtangai yogi that my surroundings and appearance directly affect how I think, feel, and behave. This is the reason the best clubs for gentlemen have a dress code. A properly groomed appearance shows respect to yourself and those around you even if you style is radically different than others. And no, having front teeth has never been a requirement. Of that I have very objective personal proof.

Next, I have to create a personal routine that creates a productive, calming, emotional state of personal reflection and focus on my connection to everything around me. My yoga training comes in handy here. I know *how* to do it but fail to actually do it. For me, making sure that I get outside when I can every day and look at the same sun, stars, and moon that every other human sees reminds me most of all that we are all fundamentally the same, siblings on Mother Earth if nothing else. This calm clears away the debris obscuring my view that allows me to see *everyone* as another human, even that person who nearly backed over me on my bike.

Finally, I need more opportunities to practice being a gentleman in public. Actually, doing gentlemanly things helps internalize my commitment to being better rather than just personifying a perception I want others to have of me. This involves forcing myself to be in places with people I both agree with and befriend as well as people that I violently disagree with. Else how can I develop the psychological muscle that gets flexed the most when severely strained.

I know I'll fail sometimes. I always do. But I also know I can do this. I have done it in the past. It's time for Rob, the gentleman yogi to return. Let the union of discipline and desire begin.
