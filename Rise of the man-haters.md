I have been a solidly respectful and decent man my whole life. Are there things in my world and psyche that I'm not even aware of? Certainly. But I have *never* been guilty of the egregious misogeny that is waved around like pictures of mutilated infants at a "pro-life" rally. Are there absolutely fucking assholes out there who are men? *Absolutely!* Am I one of them? *No.* So stop fucking lumping me in with all of them just because you disagree with me or don't want to hear what I am feeling, or worse, honest feelings that make you uncomfortable. Let me give you one example from an actual post:

>We want to give a huge shout out to ... who has done so much for ... as a friend and mentor. ... made history as the only woman ever to win ... and her dedication has been a constant inspiration for ...  Since ...she has been riding ... she chose a route about 160 kilometres longer than the one the two closest males took. 
>...
>She is hoping to win this year and show once again that women from ... are some of the toughest out there. What she is doing is nothing short of amazing and we are right here behind her every kilometre of the way.

The photo of them has the woman posting it in a bikini putting her arm around the other tired, ripped, racer.

Is this an accomplishment? Hell yeah! It should be celebrated for what it is but why does it have to be about beating "the men" and why can't it just be about the accomplishment itself. I am not saying this just because, as someone might say, "she is showing up the men" and I openly admit she is, in this race. Hell, if I cared about that I would have added a comment that she is now in fourth place behind two other men, who are 1/3 and half her age. The point is *it is not about the gender of the person, it's about the accomplishment!* 

I fucking tired of seeing this. This tribalism among women against men. I understand where it comes from but it isn't helping. In fact, it just makes it worse because I have never felt a stronger kinship with fellow men than right now. This sort of gender slamming just pushes us apart like any other tribal conflict. This is how men get radicalized and start *wrongly* thinking someone like Andrew Tate is someone to listen to. It's bad for everyone.

And for the love of Susan B. Anthony stop saying "feminism is for men as well." It's not. Gender equality is. People who say shit like that are usually the first ones to create narratives that demonize all men for the rampant and horrible sins of the men who came before us. I'm not them. I'm just not.
