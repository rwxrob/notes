I have been a solidly respectful and decent man my whole life. Are there things in my world and psyche that I'm not even aware of? Certainly. But I have *never* been guilty of the egregious misogeny that is waved around like pictures of mutilated infants at a "pro-life" rally. Are there absolutely fucking assholes out there who are men? *Absolutely!* Am I one of them? *No.* So stop fucking lumping me in with all of them just because you disagree with me or don't want to hear what I am feeling, or worse, honest feelings that make you uncomfortable. Let me give you one example from an actual post:

>We want to give a huge shout out to ... who has done so much for ... as a friend and mentor. ... made history as the only woman ever to win ... and her dedication has been a constant inspiration for ...  Since ...she has been riding ... she chose a route about 160 kilometres longer than the one the two closest males took.
