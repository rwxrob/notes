I've been updating my stats in Strava, Zwift, and Garmin including HR so I looked into it. My _actual_ max heart rate doesn't fit any of the algorithms. In 2023 [during a very competitive 40k hilly race](https://zwiftpower.com/events.php?zid=3748450) (Makuri 40) I hit 179 bpm and took bronze for my D category at the time with 206 normalized power weighing 83.8 kilos (about a kilo more than my 85.1 now) so I asked Chloe (my ChatGPT AI) about it and here's what she said. 

This all makes sense since I've been an on and off (but mostly on) endurance athlete since I was 10â€”probably even earlier. After hearing this I do wonder if I missed my big chance when I was younger to have been really competitive had I had the right coaching. I bought my first competitive bike when I was 16 by putting it on layaway and slowly paying it off.

Your real-world **HR max is what matters most**, and formulas often **underestimate fit individuals**, especially cyclists.

## ðŸ”¹ What Your 179 bpm HRmax Means
âœ… **You have a high cardiovascular capacity** â€“ your heart can sustain more beats per minute than the average 57-year-old.  
âœ… **Your body is well-conditioned for endurance efforts**, meaning you likely clear lactate efficiently.  
âœ… **Age-related max HR decline is not universal** â€“ fit endurance athletes often **maintain a higher HRmax** well into their 50s and 60s.  

### ðŸ’¡ Compare to Estimated Norms for 57-Year-Olds:
- **Typical HR max (Formula-Based):** 155-168 bpm  
- **Your HR max (Actual Measurement):** **179 bpm** ðŸŽ¯  
- **Conclusion:** You are **well above average for your age** in heart rate response, likely due to long-term endurance training.

## ðŸ”¹ Updated Heart Rate Zones (Based on 179 bpm HRmax)

| **Zone**           | **% HRmax** | **Heart Rate (bpm)** | **Purpose**                        |
| ------------------ | ----------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Z1 (Recovery)**  | 50-60%      | 90-105 bpm           | Active recovery, easy spins        |
| **Z2 (Endurance)** | 60-78%      | 106-139 bpm          | Base miles, all-day pace           |
| **Z3 (Tempo)**     | 78-87%      | 139-156 bpm          | Pushing endurance, but sustainable |
| **Z4 (Threshold)** | 87-97%      | 156-173 bpm          | Hard, but just manageable          |
| **Z5 (VO2max)**    | 97-100%     | 173-179 bpm          | Max effort, short bursts           |

These are updated to match the automated zone ranges from Strava and not consistent with other, more general ranges. I find I like them better and they also see to be more inline with the builtin HR zones from Zwift. For example, a lot of people think zone 2 is 60-70% HR and it

Specifically, I think the "winded conversation" standard for zone 2 is flawed and that the upper end of zone 2 actually goes into the "can barely form four words at a time" mode.
