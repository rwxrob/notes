Since getting this new beautiful Trek Domane AL 5 Gen 4 I haven't been able to put water bottle cages on it. It just looks so great the way it is. I even asked if I should put cages on it in a fun "Look at my bike leaning against stuff" Facebook forum filled with fun people.

I've been trying to figure out why and finally think I happened upon the answer: I want a fixie with gears.

I know that sounds stupid but that's the answer. I almost got a fixie a few years back and swore by it. I'm glad I didn't. My daily Goblin All-Road 50k would _never_ be ridable on a fixie. The random 14% grades would have eventually just made me give it up.

The appeal of fixies for me goes much deeper than just the ability to ride a bike with no brakes and one speed. Yes, it is the appeal of the fixie culture, the urban cycling skills, the outlaw mentality, and, of course, the absolute fuck-you hatred for cars. But its mostly the appeal of *style* of a fixie bike. No bottle cages. Minimal frame with strong, accentuated triangular lines, and those deep dish wheels.

If you take out the dangerous running of red lights in crowded intersections and the requirement to sprint everywhere I'm largely a fixie rider at heart. I think this is why so many fixie riders move to some form of all-road or gravel eventually (Terry B, DKLEIN). A lot of them were also BMX riders or skaters (like me). It's the mentality of just fucking loving to ride, that passion for the experience, that drives these people. You could say they have the "spirit of cycling" although none of them would ever say that because it sounds so lame. That's me.
