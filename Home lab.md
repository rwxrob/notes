*Why do I need a home lab?*

Keep up with stuff from work and vibe coding.

*What do I need to practice from work?*

- Coding in Go, bash (even though I do POSIX at home), Perl, Python
- ML job submission API with endpoints 
- Kubernetes setup with Kubespray
- k8sapp specification
- Ansible in general
- Machine learning job submission to Kubernetes applications

*Does it need to be running all the time?*

No. Just to try out new things. If and when I need a server I will use a cloud provider like one of the following:

- Digital Ocean
- Contabo
- Hetzner
- GCP
