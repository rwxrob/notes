After a full year of testing and paying for Starlink, both a full version and the Mini with both unlimited with $50/month subscription I can confidently say that for my preferred style of streaming and riding Starlink is not worth it. Here's why.

***Expensive***:  At $165/month to get the unlimited bandwidth needed you are paying the cost of 2-3 unlimited mobile plans. Sure you get more bandwidth when it works but having two unlimited plans as backup are _always_ required.

***Incomplete***: Starlink absolutely cannot stream with even minimal tree cover and in North Carolina this is a *major* issue. Every wooded gravel and mountain bike trail—not to mention most slow-paced suburban streets—are overgrown with wonderful, beautiful trees, trees that disable Starlink almost entirely.

***Glitchy***: By itself, Starlink regularly gets out of sync causing annoying 

***Heavy***: Even the Mini weighs a lot more than a Nighthawk M6 modem *with battery*.
