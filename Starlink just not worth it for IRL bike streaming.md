After a full year of testing the Starlink, both a full version and the mini with unlimited I can confidently say that for 90% of my riding and live streams it just isn't needed. Here's a summary of why.

***Expensive***:  At $165/month to get the unlimited bandwidth needed you are paying the cost of 2-3 unlimited mobile plans. Sure you get more bandwidth when it works but having two unlimited plans as backup are _always_ required.

***Heavy***: Even the Mini weighs a lot more than a Nighthawk M6 modem *with battery*.
