I've spend probably over $1000 testing new underwear of all kinds only to keep realizing how amazing ExOfficio Active underwear is. It's got everything:

* Gussetted
* Moisture wicking for days
* Antibacterial
* Minimal seams to avoid chaffing
* Strong, dependable elastic that does not fold or give after years of wear

I've been wearing these instead of bike shorts under my overshorts to add just a bit of padding and wicking
