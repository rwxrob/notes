I have slammed [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) in the past for encouraging divergent Markdown usage and lock-in but—as I've always said—the one thing that would get me to use it would ultimately be its seamless integration with _any_ mobile phone platform particularly as someone who lives a large percentage of life on my bike. Now that I know it can be used in a way that is 100% compatible with GitHub Flavored Markdown I use it without worry.
