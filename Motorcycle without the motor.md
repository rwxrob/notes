Today on my ride I realized I'm really just want a motorcycle without the motor where I _am_ the motor. I just love sensation of speed be it on pristine tarmac or perfectly paved MTB trails with lots of flow and twists. 

## Not a bike tourist

This realization helps explain why bike touring did not work out for me. The bike part of bike touring sucks. I mean it _really_ sucks. The entire time I did I all I could think was how fast I could go on that section if I didn't have all that weight or dared to send it on the descents. Nope. I am most certainly _not_ a bike tourist.
