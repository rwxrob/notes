Why is this  my next bike:

- Manual shifting sucks on a Gran Fondo or typical road race (shifting fatigue is a thing)
- Fewer mechanical parts to vibrate around and be annoying, 105 mechanical is hella noisy
- Ultegra electronic is way better than mechanical 105
- Prettier bike color choices (SL 6 are god-awful ugly)
- Still an all-road bike meaning I can do Love Valley Roubaix with 38c gravel tires (not interested in anything but "light gravel")
-
