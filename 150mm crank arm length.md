1.75m tall pros have been spotted with unattainable 150mm crank arms in training this winter. This is part of a trend to go smaller and smaller in pro cycling. Here's why:

- Less overall stress on knees and hip flexors
- Promotes faster cadence overall
- More ground clearance (think gravel and all-road)
- Greater angle for pedaling through turns
- Less toe-wheel overlap

As an aging cyclist who has done a lot of things that have stressed my knees and flexors over the years I can say that I _definitely_ will be getting 150mm cranks on my next bike. Either putting them on this one or the next one I get. Only 160mm are available for now so I'll have to wait anyway.

In fact, if I had 160mm instead of 172.5 I'm quite sure my shoes would not overlap with the front wheel at all. But too much hassle and expense (about )
