1.75m tall pros have been spotted with unattainable 150mm crank arms in training this winter. This is part of a trend to go smaller and smaller in pro cycling. Here's why:

- Less overall stress on knees and hip flexors
- Better ergonomic aero position
- Promotes faster cadence overall
- More ground clearance (think gravel and all-road)
- Greater angle for pedaling through turns
- Less toe-wheel overlap

The only thing you give up is torque to push through lower cadences while climbing and such.

As an aging cyclist who has done a lot of things that have stressed my knees and flexors over the years I can say that I _definitely_ will be getting 150mm cranks on my next bike. Either putting them on this one or the next one I get. Only 160mm are available for now so I'll have to wait anyway.

In fact, if I had 160mm instead of 172.5 I'm quite sure my shoes would not overlap with the front wheel at all. But too much hassle and expense (about $250) just to convert my current bike. I've been riding 170 and 172.5 my entire life so I'll be fine for another year.

Personally, I think the shortest cranks possible should be the default for _all_ cyclists over 50â€”especially those carrying a little weight around the middle. Every millimeter of clearance that keeps my knees from hitting my gut would make me just that much happier. Let's face it, as we age, we are less likely to have stuff that our thighs and knees will hit the more aero we go. This is something that is very noticeable when losing weight. My position suddenly gets a lot better because my hands are not supporting as much weight and I can bend at the middle better without it being really uncomfortable on my gut. Shorter cranks just improve all that even more.
