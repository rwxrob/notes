Here you'll find my personal notes about anything and everything. It pairs with my [lab](https://github.com/rwxrob/lab) repo where I keep any code I'm testing out. Here are a few links to information about my personal knowledge management workflow:

*  [Why I use GitHub Flavored Markdown](Why%20I%20use%20GitHub%20Flavored%20Markdown.md)
* [Why I use Obsidian](Why%20I%20use%20Obsidian.md)
* Why I don't follow _most_ of Zettelkasten approach
* [Why I'm okay with spaces in my filenames for notes](Why%20I'm%20okay%20with%20spaces%20in%20my%20filenames%20for%20notes.md)
