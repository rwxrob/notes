## Considerations

***I'm old.***  I don't recover like my youth. This means unless I want to go on TRT I need to keep it really light in order to recover from *any* strength training at all. It also means that to combat sarcopenia I *must* do at least two sessions of strength training a week to have a life worth living the way I want in retirement.
