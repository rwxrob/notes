The Cheaha challenge is the only "partner" even that includes the overall start-to-finish time in the calculation of final GFNAT points. This defeats the main attraction of the GFnat series in the first place. The entire point of the Gran Fondo series is to promote casual fun at the rest stops and camaraderie while allowing serious competition during the timed segments.

There are also several other reasons I won't be doing Cheaha ever again:

- Forcing 55-59 UCI to do the Medio instead of the GranSerious descents for miles on roads sharing regular tourist traffic
- 
- Slow climbers and descenders on *the same open roads*
- History of serious accidents
- Absolutely horrible road quality for an event of this size
