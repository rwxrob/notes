Sardines in olive oil are half as much as eggs as a source of protein and come with the added advantages of healthy olive oil fat creating a very satisfying meal at 150 calories all by  themselves. Combining with eggs and Orgain provides a very well balanced mix of protein sources that are relatively cheap.
