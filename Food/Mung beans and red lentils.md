Watching this video has reminded me that when I was eating a plant based diet I was in the best shape of my life. The problem for me always is digestion. So many of the least dense foods just are not digestible for my finicky gut. Grinding everything up into a smoothy or soup certainly has helped in the past, but that reduces the satisfaction from having an actual meal.

With this in mind, I'm intent on trying to add legumes back to my diet. I do know I can do lentils without a problem. And I'm intrigued by mung beans. Rice is a clean carb that is far better than any other processed carb I can eat. White rice is the easiest to digest (for me). Basically, I want to come up with a "burrito bowl" that doesn't have black or pinto beans (which are the worst for gut health and digestion) and uses lentils or mung beans instead. Apparently mung beans are the easiest to digestâ€”especially if left out to soak overnight.

I'm looking forward to honing in on some recipes that are super easy to heat up in the microwave during the week for lunch or dinner and share them in a few tik-tok videos.
