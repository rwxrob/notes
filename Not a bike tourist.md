Realizing I'm [addicted to cruising speed](Addicted%20to%20cruising%20speed.md) has helped explain why bike touring did not work out for me. The bike part of bike touring sucks. I mean it _really_ sucks. And let's be honest, the touring part is America is really bad. I don't want to tour the traffic of every different American small town with its dogs and trucks and idiots.

The entire time I really focused on bike touring all I could think was how fast I could go on given section of road if I didn't have all that weight or dared to send it on the descents. Sometimes I'd think how trapped I was on that big, lumbering behemoth. There was absolutely no getting myself out of trouble with that, no "picking lines" through urban traffic. I crave that and not having it really bothered me.
