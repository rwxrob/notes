This realization helps explain why bike touring did not work out for me. The bike part of bike touring sucks. I mean it _really_ sucks. The entire time I did I all I could think was how fast I could go on that section if I didn't have all that weight or dared to send it on the descents. Nope. I am most certainly _not_ a bike tourist.
