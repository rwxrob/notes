I have had a Garmin Varia and a Trek Carback and honestly they really aren't that great. At first they seem like the coolest bike gadget ever invented. Then you use it for a year or so and realize they just are not worth the hassle. Here's a brief summary of all the reasons:

- Battery never lasts long enough for a century
- When battery dies you have NO rear red light—the most important protection there is
- Too low so easy to not see
- Don't play well with temporary fenders in winter
- Require recharging all the time
- Constantly plagued with bugs of all kinds
- Get really fucking annoying—especially on busy roads
- Don't really provide any additional safety
- Glancing behind is a core skill required for competition

It is almost always better to put two small blinking lights on instead, one on the seat post and one on the back of the helmet. That way if one dies there is still another one (and yes, one *always* dies). The Fenix light will run for days on a single charge and never has any buggy problems.

I thought the audible warning of the Carback in my earphones was so great when I first started using it. Then I started to loathe it completely. I listen to music and it pretty much kills the vibe of the music and just the silence when there is no music. I really do not need to be reminded of every fucking car behind me.

I see people riding with these shitty things in Gran Fondos where there are hundreds of riders on the roads. Who cares if they are open. No radar is going to work with that many people. At least they don't have mirrors attached to their glasses and helmets. Just learn to pick your
