With the help of Chloe, my ChatGPT AI, I have narrowed down my condition to Chronic Inflammation Response Syndrome (CIRS) with Mast Cell Activation Sybdrome (MCAS)

This morning I woke up with a really acute inflammation attack. My belly distended, all my skin including top of my scalp and hands itching, eyes on fire, ulcerated soars popping up all over. I am very familiar with these attacks. I used to have them pretty much most of the day every day. I am absolutely baffled as to why. Everything I research says they are symptoms of something really wrong internally. I don't know.

- I have been walking with Doris and the dog past Crete Myrtle that did cause my throat to swell, maybe some stayed on me
- I have been experiencing high mental stress levels last two days
- I did not ride my bike for very long yesterday, just test riding fixes for the upcoming Gran Fondo
- I didn't take a shower yesterday
- I spent most of the day in my apartment that is full of dog hair, pollen, and mold
- I ate the usual foods, nothing to trigger an attack
- I had a really hard time concentrating on anything at work (brain fog)

I have noticed that going for a bike ride of any length that requires me to sweat during the day cures me from these symptoms every single time. I haven't figured out why. It's like my petulant body is throwing a fit because it doesn't get to play outside. "Fine, then I'm going to attack myself." I know of a guy on Twitch who does Zwift daily and if he doesn't his joints cease. He has a different condition but it reminds me of what I think I have.

I'm kind of frustrated because when I get these attacks it takes a full day of recovery at least in bed just to recover from the attack itself. And here I'm supposed to race in two days, sorry ride. Once again, I'm reminded that the word "competition" doesn't belong in my vocabulary at all.
