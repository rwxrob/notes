## 11 am departure

Depart at 11am most days so 11-1 weekdays. Logistics and weather is just ideal and predictable at that time. Afternoons are almost always rainy in NC. Before 11 is very cold and damp from dew usually. No school traffic as well.

## 40k standard length

40 km efforts are also easiest logistically and time-wise during the week. They are easily finished in under two hours. Since hydration and nutrition are per hour and per bottle that gives me two bottles to manage, 550ml or 750ml. The duration is less than anything that would require a complicated pit stop or refueling strategy.
