After realizing I don't have an extra 90 minutes twice a week for strength training in addition to my 2-5 hour daily rides I've decided to just not do any off-bike strength training. After all, I'm not training to win anything. I'm going for consistency and sustainability over event-driven performance.

If anything, I'm on a perpetual bike trip that begins and ends at my bike shed . I'm maintain fitness and strength into my senior years and creating highly sustainable habits and deeply engraining them into my body and soul. Going to the gym just ain't gonna happen. I freaking hate the gym, always have.

Without the gym and squats and deadlifts I can say goodbye to raw strength gains, but I can still build strength and even some hypertrophy on the bike by just sprinting and pushing the hillsâ€”especially out of the saddle. I know this because I did it already. For more than a decade as a kid I built leg strength and size using nothing more than my bike. I know seniors slow down muscle building and need more recovery, but still.

Dropping the gym also means I'm far less likely to get injured. Senior bones and tendons and muscles + high-intensity lifting in the gym is a total recipe for life-crippling injury. Yoga and pull ups are all I need to add to regular rides, which is all I ever planned for upper body core anyway because I don't want to get heavier even if I look better jacked.
