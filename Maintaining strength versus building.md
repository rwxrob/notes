I hate the gym. I always have. So no, despite all the videos and suggestions that senior go I won't. I might not make big strength and power gains (like I did as a triathlete doing squats) but I _can_ maintain strength just on the bike. I know it because I did it for years.

While looking at my schedule I realized I don't have an extra 90 minutes twice a week for strength training in addition to my 2-5 hour daily rides. I sure as hell am not replacing a beautiful ride at sunset around the lake with a strength gym session indoors. Life is too short for that shit.

Besides, I'm not training to win anything. I'm training for consistent and sustainable fitness and fun over time rather than event-driven performance. It's 

If anything, I'm on a perpetual bike trip that begins and ends at my bike shed. I

Without the gym and squats and deadlifts I can say goodbye to raw strength gains, but I can still build strength and even some hypertrophy on the bike by just sprinting and pushing the hillsâ€”especially out of the saddle. I know this because I did it already. For more than a decade as a kid I built leg strength and size using nothing more than my bike. I know seniors slow down muscle building and need more recovery, but still.

Dropping the gym also means I'm far less likely to get injured. Senior bones and tendons and muscles + high-intensity lifting in the gym is a total recipe for life-crippling injury. Yoga and pull ups are all I need to add to regular rides, which is all I ever planned for upper body core anyway because I don't want to get heavier even if I look better jacked.
