While looking at my schedule I realized I don't have an extra 90 minutes twice a week for strength training in addition to my 2-5 hour daily rides. I sure as hell am not replacing a beautiful ride at sunset around the lake with a strength gym session indoors. Life is too short for that.

I hate the gym. I always have. Despite all the videos and suggestions that senior build strength in the gym I won't. I might not make big strength and power gains (like I did as a triathlete doing squats) but I _can_ maintain strength just on the bike. I know because I did it for years. All it takes is safely pushing it on sprints and hills with _extreme_ attention to any pain in the knees at all.

Yoga and pull ups are all I need to add to regular rides and I can easily do that before or after a ride. Besides, yoga is a pe



Besides, I'm not training to win anything. I'm training for consistent and sustainable fitness and fun over time rather than event-driven performance. The goals are entirely different.
