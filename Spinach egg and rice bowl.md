This is my main goto meal that satisfies all my normal macro and some micro nutritional needs when combined with the rest of a good daily nutrition strategy is this rice bowl combined with eggs, spinach, and extra virgin olive oil. The spinach covers the hard to cover greens that are always hard to fit in. I vary the rice grams depending on what training things that are happening. I can eat this at any time of day but usually _after_ training since it takes longer to digest than simple rice to carb load two hours before an event, which is good because it is very satisfying keeping me from getting hungry as much throughout the day.

- 2 hard boiled eggs
- 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 90g frozen spinach
- 200g cooked basmati rice
- Smoked paprika
- Salt

I smash up the eggs in the oil and add the salt and paprika while I'm heating up the spinach in a bowl in the microwave. Then I add the egg mash to the spinach in the bowl, add in the rice, and heat the whole thing in the microwave for about a minute. Then I just mix it up with a fork.

If after a ride I'll pair with a non-alcoholic Sam Adams IPA (another 22g carb and 1.5 protein).
