My main goto meal that satisfies all my normal macro and micro nutritional needs when combined with the rest of a good daily nutrition strategy is this rice bowl combined with eggs, spinach, and extra virgin olive oil. I vary the rice grams depending on what training things that are happening. I can eat this at any time of day but usually _after_ training since it takes longer to digest than simple rice to carb load two hours before an event, which is 

- 2 hard boiled eggs
- Extra virgin olive oil
- 90g frozen spinach
- 200g cooked basmati rice
- Smoked paprika
- Salt
