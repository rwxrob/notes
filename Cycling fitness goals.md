I always do better with a goal. For cycling my goal is to be a podium finisher in any eSports bike race I seriously enter for the rest of my life. More than half the esports competitors I race against are over the age of 50—and a significant number are over 70! This is a fitness goal I can hold onto forever.

## 4.0 W/kg

To pull this off consistent wins I'm going to need to reach 4.0 W/kg. I know that sounds like a lot—especially for an old fart like me—but I want to dream big here.

## Sprinter focus

I don't have the physical dimensions to be a classics all-rounder and I don't want to go all the way to climber extreme weight loss, which puts me closer to the sprinter category. This is also a good category for someone with a heavier IRL bike like my top-of-the-entry-level Trek Domane AL 5 Gen 4.

I definitely have the mental attitude and genetics for sprinting and a very high threshold for pain. It's what made me a decent triathlete (although, let's be honest, at 174 cm I'm far too short for competitive triathletes).

Sprinting also pairs well with mountain bike roller-coaster riding, which I absolutely love.

## Weight: 67

To have any chance of hitting those W/kg I have to get my weight down to 67 kilos (from 85 currently). I managed to get to 77 last year and then completely blew it. At 0.25 kilos per week loss that will take 1.5 years. I think anything more than that is far too aggressive to still enjoy life. I'm not in a huge hurry—although I would like to *not* be in the "overweight" BMI category by May.

## FTP: 270

Honestly, I would *love* to hit 300 but 270 is a very high goal. I didn't really have a sense of what a good FTP was last year but the more I have been following other competitors and watching my own FTP I realize this is an attainable but aggressive goal. I hit 241 in 2024 and I'm pretty sure if Summer had not derailed my training entirely I could have pushed it up higher.

## Prioritize sleep

The secret to all of this is mostly sleep. Sleep allows me to do two training sessions per day and fully recover. Sneaking an extra two hour nap in the middle of day and still hitting the training hours and work requirements means that there really isn't much time for anything else—especially live streaming stupid tech stuff. In fact, since abandoning tech streaming almost a month ago I have an absolute aversion to the idea of doing it at all. All my motivation for book writing and boost stuff is not just gone
## Consistency is key

As with any training, I have to remember that it is the marginal daily gains that matter.
