I always do better with goal  (until I hit them and start looking for different goals, which happens all the time). For cycling my goal is to be a podium finisher in any eSports bike race I seriously enter.

## 4.0 W/kg

To pull this off I'm going to need to reach 4.0 W/kg. I know that sounds like a lot but I want to dream big here.

## Sprinter focus

I don't have the physical dimensions to be a classics all-rounder and I don't want to go all the way to climber extreme weight loss, which puts me closer to the sprinter category. This is also a good category for someone with a heavier bike like my top-of-the-entry-level Trek Domane AL 5 Gen 4.

I definitely have the genetics for sprinting and a very high threshold for pain. It's what made me a decent triathlete (although, let's be honest I'm far too short for competitive triathletes).

Sprinting also pairs well with mountain bike roller-coaster trail riding, which I absolutely love.

## Weight: 67

To have any chance I have to get my weight down to 67 kilos (from 85 currently). I managed to get to 77 last year and then completely blew it. At 0.25 kilos per week loss that will take 1.5 years. I think anything more than that is far too aggressive to still enjoy life.
