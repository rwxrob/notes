I always do better with goal  (until I hit them and start looking for different goals, which happens all the time). For cycling my goal is to be a podium finisher in any eSports bike race I seriously enter.

## Weight

To have any chance I have to get my weight down to 67 kilos (from 85 currently). I managed to get to 77 last year and then completely blew it. At 0.25 kilos per week loss that will take 1.5 years. I think anything more than that is far too aggressive to still enjoy life.
