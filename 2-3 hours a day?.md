Case you haven't done the math, that's about 18 hours per week. That's just under the pro 20+ hour level of volume by most standards. But here's the thing, I am not a pro.

So subtracting, say, one hour per day just to maintain minimum human function of my body that would put my "training" hours someplace in the 11 hours per week range, about the same as any other weekend warrior wanting to keep up with a curated group of fast friends.
