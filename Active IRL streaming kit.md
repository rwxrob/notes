Here's everything I use to do active live streaming IRL.

## Stuff you need

- 2-3 high-power modems

## Questions

*Should I use a phone or dedicated ?*

- Phones never get the same range as a good hot spot
- Best hot spot on the market is Netgear Nighthawk

*What about StarLink Mini?*

- Only works under open sky
- Unlimited bandwidth when it works
- Extremely large bitrates possible
- Glitches about every five minutes
- Largest attachable battery lasts 4.5 hours
