Over the years what I eat has really changed based on level of activity, training, budget, and available options. Here's there I keep track of what I eat over the course of a month and how much it costs. I have to do these every once in a while to remind myself how much cheaper and better for my health it is to _not_ eat out, ever. I feel like so many endurance athletes, pros and casuals, just don't get this right. I know I mess it up a lot. Here are the main points:

- Absolutely, positively no alcoholâ€”especially not that Sam Adams _Just the Hop_ exists
- No fried food whatsoever
- Use Huel instead of daily multi-vitamins and fish oil
- Focus on good cheap carbs to fill up: rice, waffles, potatoes

Here's my normal weekday food intake:

- Coffee + waffle + two hardboiled eggs mashed up with 1 tbsp mayo, paprika, salt (wake)
- waffle + 1 scoop Huel Black Chocolate(+3 hours)
- 1 cup white rice + 1 cup lentils (2 hours before ride)
