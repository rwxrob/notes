As I've been planning for two-day bike trips to places that are relatively close, I figure that can become a pattern. I could spend the day biking to a location with a communal campsite, airbnb, or cheap hotel, and then just meet anyone who wants to hang out there for dinner and just socializing in that area. The locations could vary:

- Carowinds KOA
- AirBnBs
