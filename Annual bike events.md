Love https://ncsports.org/ and their supported cycling events. I cannot wait to do my first this year. They really take the hassle out of the whole logistics thing and make the tough decision about *where* to ride differently every year. Eventually, I plan on doing all their events, (mountains to coast, mountain, and coastal).

I also really love that my home town (Davidson) hosts the Lake Norman Fondo event every year. It has all the local cyclists in it so it's a fun way to keep connected.

Eventually, I want to travel someplace and rent a bike and do another week someplace exotic and fully supported.
