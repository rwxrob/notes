> Currently, we do not reduce data speeds on our Unlimited Service Plans, including our Unlimited Plan and our Unnecessary Plan; however, as described above, Heavy Data Users (customers on our Unlimited Service Plans ***who use more than 35GB of data in a month***), will have their data usage prioritized below the data usage (including tethering) of other customers for the rest of the monthly billing cycle, at times and at locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources, which may result in slower data speeds for the remainder of the month.Â For the avoidance of doubt, Mobile HotSpot (tethering) counts towards Heavy Data User thresholds of our Unlimited Service Plans, and any usage of Mobile HotSpot (tethering) after the Heavy Data User threshold is reached, including any such usage made via add-on hotspot purchases to the extent available, will be subjected to lower prioritization. Certain data-intensive activities including but not limited to online gaming, file downloads/uploads, and video streaming, may be limited and/or inaccessible when our network is busy for Heavy Data Users for the remainder of the month.

The "unlimited" is absolutely not unlimited since it *throttles data to whatever it wants and does not disclose the numbers* for "heavy data users" who use more than 35GB. This unreliability is absolutely unsustainable for reliable IRL live streaming.
