I cannot overstate how amazing this change has been for my cycling. I swear I'm putting out 10% more power with 30% less pain. It's so hard to describe. That cycle of pain per leg is so much less enabling me to hammer the pedals so much more aggressively. I have genetically short legs and am only 174cm so this is literally the best possible thing I could have done to my road bike to increase my power and durability.

I once noticed that higher RPMs produce more power on the power meter. I was doing it in Zwift. Then I noticed it on the road. I'm not sure why, perhaps the nature of how it is measured but I would bet that a longer stroke has a lot more bell curve to it. The edges of the curve are not optimal because they are not in that highest torque possible area. With the shorter cranks I feel like the _only_ thing left is that high torque area. I just have to increase the cadence to get same power but the result is less waste, sort of like when swimming how important it is to maintain a pull consistently on the water because of the resistance. There is far less pause where a slowing could happen. Longer cranks make for harder presses as well. I would say that it takes 1.6 strokes to get the same power of 1 stroke of the 172.5 but the peak power of that stroke and the wasted ramp up to reach that peak power during the stroke is significantly reduced meaning more constant power per second.

My cadence on the group ride never dropped below 92 and most of the time was 100 or more. Almost none of the other riders had a cadence anywhere near that. I almost don't want to tell them. I suppose I will if they ask. I have nothing to hide. But I don't fee the need to justify my decisions to them.
