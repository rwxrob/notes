I'm training my gut to use the same stuff available at pretty much any supported ride:

- Gatorade with ice
- Bananas
- Rice crispy treats
- Glucose/Fructose gels with maltodextrin

So far I've had much better results with actual food than the performance stuff. I've noticed that I get palette fatigue really quickly with gels.

I'm also preparing for the very specific, excellent, and reliable nutrition provided *only* by the official Suarez Gran Fondo National Series events:

- Hammer Nutrition
- ...

*Funny reading this former plan now that I'm 100% focused on official GFNats with different goals.*

The secret to durability is carbs, on race day _and_ on every training day.

- Pre-fuel on waffles or other carb (120g) 2-3 hours before event
- Carry own homemade gel since predictable, supplement with feed zones if and when needed (just bananas)
- Adapt homemade gel to conditions (pace, gut training, sodium) in 250ml flasks with hourly carb + electrolyte
- Plan from 50g to 120g per hour to [match power output](Carbs%20burned%20per%20watt%20per%20hour.md)
- Plan own nutrition for max of six hours if more is needed supplement with external sources on ride
- Never anything but water in bottles to keep feed zones fast and allow water for cooling, cleaning injuries, dogs, etc.
- Decide on whether 550 or 750ml bottles based on feed zones frequency
- No-doze (200mg caffeine) at hour 3 and optionally another at hour 4 (never more since 400mg is max).
