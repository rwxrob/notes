I ride mostly for the vibes and fitness but I'm also pretty damn competitive. When I race it is mostly against myself with an occasional group dynamic. For all-out crit racing and race-craft I'm on the indoor bike. Don't want to break a collar-bone, or a hip. The most competitive racing I do outside is usually endurance based (gran fondos, gravel racing, supported groups). I generally avoid spicy regular group rides.

The Domane (all-road) is my main bike and has three wheel sets:

1. Swiss-side 26/28c, 63mm deep aero, tubeless (most of the year)
2. Stock bontrager, 32c, tubeless (winter, slam them up)
3. Maxxis rambler 38/40c, tubeless (light gravel)

My Salsa Marrakesh ("Keshy") is a tank designed for ultra-stable, long-distance, longevity. She doesn't go anywhere (but downhill) fast, but the places she *can* go with the stuff she can carry make it worth it. For example, while it might take forever to climb Logan canyon when I do get to the top I can put on my parka or hop into my huge cozy sleeping bag and tent to have a great time out in Fall, Spring, and even Winter. Keshy has two quick-release wheel sets that are also tanks in terms of never breaking spokes under load:

1. 38 Renee Herse slicks, tubeless (roads)
2. Vittoria Mescal 2.1, tubeless (everything else)

I haven't started gravel racing but I'm looking forward to starting and when I do I'll get an Allied Able that will take up to 57c tires.
