Lachlan Morton rode Unbound XL 2025 without valve cores. At this point if you are running tubeless and *don't* have Muc-Off Big Bore valves (or an equivalent) you are kind of living dangerously—especially if you are doing big miles on chonk. 

- Ball value instead of shitty valve core
- 240%+ more air flow
- Easily add sealant without unseating tire
- Better attachment to rim with o-ring as well as seal

In fact, these things might even finish off presta valve stems forever since bike tire technology is now completely in sync with tubeless car and motorcycles tires and high-pressure shader valve tire inflation is far more available on the road.
