Just did my first indoor ride with a new kit I paid $200 for that would have cost 2-3 times more if I bought Le Col or some other overpriced shit. I cannot overstate how amazing these clothes are for road cyclingâ€”especially trying the wicking undershirt with a jersey and to take the edge off the bib straps:

* NeoPro Onyx Cargo Bibs V2.0 ($80)
* NeoPro White Undershirt (will change to black later) ($35)
* NeoPro Socks - Black ($10)
* NeoPro Vanta Jersey ($45)

These are "Amazon" prices but for quality stuff. I probably will never buy road kit that *isn't* Neopro after trying this stuff. I could not believe what a difference it even made indoors keeping me cooler by wicking sweat away and evaporating it faster from a single fan. It's tight but for some reason still comfortable. I don't know how they do that magic. I'm seriously getting rid of all the other poorly fitting road kit I have left around and just wearing Neopro from now on. It's that good. Okay, I'll keep my $220 Le Col bibs, which are strangely no better than these NeoPro $80 ones.
