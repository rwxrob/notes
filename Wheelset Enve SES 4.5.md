Eventually (probably in 2026) I'll buy these instead of a new bike. Then I'll go a few years without a new bike and save up for something.

These wheels are specifically optimized for non-peloton all-road riding, sturdy enough for light gravel and a bit of fastpacking load, but light and fast enough targeted at aero performance at 32 kph, perfect for me.

Plus these look so damn *sick* on my Domane that wants to be a bike messenger bike.

The only downside is how freaking loud these are.
