I'm reminded today that I'm primarily a roadieâ€”specifically an all-roadie. Here's why.

The main draw of cycling for me is averaging between 25 and 30 kph all the time through safe, scenic landscapes of all kinds. This speed is perfect to get that feeling of floating over the landscape. You have to have done it to understand the sensation but once you have you get addicted. 

Cruising at that speed on an unencumbered road bike usually means I'm also 

Today on my ride I realized I'm really just want a motorcycle without the motor where I _am_ the motor. I just love sensation of speed be it on pristine tarmac or perfectly paved MTB trails with lots of flow and twists. Feeling the wind on those 50-60kph descents and knowing I'm safe on my new Domane on suburban streets is what I would consider nearly perfection. The equivalent off road is also appealing, which is why I got a HTC trail bike as well.
