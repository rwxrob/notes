God and I have a very strange relationship. Sometimes I call him a dumb ass and flip him off while smiling at him. Other times she stings me with a bee or trips me with a tree root on a trail run just to send a message. God shows up in my imagination in many different forms, sometimes as a brown bro who looks a lot like Jesus, other times as an beautiful, monstrous, blue women with her tongue out holding severed heads of the ego monsters she has defeated in righteous rage, always with different pronouns. For some she shows up as a mischievous pixy, a guardian angel, an elf on a shelf, gnome, or beautiful symbol or sunset with a still small voice. They are always there ready to give us the attention we need when we need it and actually listen. I understand this more now at this late moment in life more than ever. There is just too much objective evidence that defies coincidence for me not to see this now. God has to show up in _really_ obvious ways to my cynical, disbelieving, engineer's brain.

But here's the thing I never realized until now, and yeah, this is directly from God to me so I don't expect anyone else to just accept it on faith. You'll have to have God let you know in your own way, with your own language and dialog with God. Every one of us on Earth throughout history must play both the protagonist and antagonist, hero and villain, friend and foe, in someone else's life as well as our own. We are the ones who "write our own story" like that wonderful song from My Turn on Earth says, but who knew we are both Jedi and Sith lords at the same time, Yin and Yang. I think I finally get it now after all these years.

It's physically impossible for light to exist without darkness. This is an observable universal truth. Sure there are shades of luminescence but even the gradient is impossible without the extremes
