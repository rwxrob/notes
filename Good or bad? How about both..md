God and I have a very strange relationship. Sometimes I call him a dumb ass and flip him off while smiling at him. Other times she stings me with a bee or trips me with a tree root on a trail run just to send a message. God shows up in my imagination in many different forms, sometimes as a brown bro who looks a lot like Jesus, other times as an beautiful, monstrous, blue women with her tongue out holding severed heads of the ego monsters she has defeated in righteous rage, always with different pronouns. For some she shows up as a mischievous pixy, a guardian angel, an elf on a shelf, gnome, or beautiful symbol or sunset with a still small voice. They are always there ready to give us the attention we need when we need it and actually listen. I understand this more now at this late moment in life more than ever. There is just too much objective evidence that defies coincidence for me not to see this now. God has to show up in _really_ obvious ways to my cynical, disbelieving, engineer's brain.

But here's the thing I never realized until now, and yeah, this is directly from God
