God and I have a very strange relationship. Sometimes I call him a dumb ass and flip him off while smiling at him. Other times she stings me with a bee or trips me with a tree root on a trail run just to send a message. God shows up in my imagination in many different forms, sometimes as a brown hippy bro who looks a lot like Jesus, other times as an beautiful, monstrous, blue women with her tongue out holding severed heads of the ego monsters she has defeated in righteous rage, always with different pronouns. For some she shows up as a mischievous pixy, a guardian angel, an elf on a shelf, gnome, or beautiful symbol or sunset with a still small voice. They are always there ready to give us the attention we need when we need it and actually listen. I understand this more now at this late moment in life more than ever. There is just too much objective evidence that defies coincidence for me not to see this now. God has to show up in _really_ obvious ways to my cynical, disbelieving, engineer's brain.

But here's the thing I never realized until now, and yeah, this is directly from God to me so I don't expect anyone else to just accept it on faith. You'll have to have God let you know in your own way, with your own language and dialog with God. Every one of us on Earth throughout history must play both the protagonist and antagonist, hero and villain, friend and foe, in someone else's life as well as our own. We are the ones who "write our own story" like that wonderful song from My Turn on Earth says, but who knew each of us is both a Jedi and Sith lord at the same time, Yin and Yang. I think I finally get it now after all these years.

It's physically impossible for light to exist without darkness. This is an observable universal truth. Sure there are shades of luminescence but even the gradient is impossible without the extremes. Observable waves of energy have a crest and a trough, a place of high pressure and low, an on and and off, a one and a zero. This is perhaps the most observable, self-evident property of all creation. Nothing can exist without this. All laws of science and spirituality are based on it.

There can be no growth without opposition, contrast, sometimes painful and other times joyful. This fundamentally means that we cannot grow unless someone or something else acts as a catalyst and source of pain for us, intention or otherwise. Loss of a loved one provides an opportunity for growth just as when we are intentionally or accidentally the source of immense pain to others.

A girl excited to have fun with her friend out on the town might not pay enough attention to avoid forcing an unsuspecting cyclist's face into the pavement breaking his nose and all his front teeth causing his jaded soul to see humanity in a new way as the unsung heroes of the ER and EMTs patch him back together helping him literally find his smile again.

A man full of toxic subconscious pain might lash out at unsuspecting at surprised, dreadfully hurt people who he deeply random strangers or even people he deeply loves for no obvious reason they can see forcing them to face their own trials and trauma.

Growth comes from trauma and resistance, whether it is from adapting to and repairing micro-tears  in muscle fibers brought on through strength training, or being forced to ask extremely painful questions when others hurt us, willingly or otherwise. It is our response to the stress, resistance, opposition, and damage that defines our growth and improvement.

God knows what we are capable of and even though God sometimes puts certain humans through unfathomable trials composed of huge waves and storms this is not because God is an asshole (even though I love calling him that when I talk to him/her/them). God just understands the vibrations of existence composed of waves with highs and lows. In fact, God may very well just _be_ those vibrations undulating through us all in every form, physical and spiritual.

Why does understanding this matter? Because internalizing it as the basis of our own growth helps us accept the good with the bad and continue to progress. We stop seeing each other as friend or foe and simply actors in our own story. When we become blinded to this one fundamental truth and lose our own balance and ability to remain stable, wallowing in self-pity and remorse for the horrors of our time playing the villain in someone else's story, or losing ourselves to ego when our wave is at it's peak about to crest and crash.

The more we remember that this fundamental law of existence requires that each of us _must_ play the part of antagonist in someone else's story from time to time—usually outside of our full control—the more balanced we remain even during own our moments—yes, of failure—but also essential opposition helping another to grow from being that "bad guy" in someone else's life. And when we are flying high keeping this truth in mind reminds us that eventually, if not already, we are not just the hero but inevitably a villain as well. We are all protagonists and antagonists. Sometimes we are acting and other times reacting, but we are eternally caught in this cycle of Universal vibration. It is the very nature of existence.
