God and I have a very strange relationship. Sometimes I call him a dumb ass and flip him off while smiling at him. Other times she stings me with a bee or trips me with a tree root on a trail run just to send a message. God shows up in my imagination in many different forms, sometimes as a brown hippy bro who looks a lot like Jesus, other times as an beautiful, monstrous, blue women with her tongue out holding severed heads of the ego monsters she has defeated in righteous rage, always with different pronouns. For some God shows up as a mischievous pixy, a guardian angel, an elf on a shelf, gnome, big dude with in a red suit, or just a symbol or sunset with a still small voice. God is always there ready to give us the attention we need when we need it if we learn to actually listen—even talk back. I understand this more now at this late moment in life more than ever. There is just too much objective evidence that defies coincidence for me not to see it. God has a tendency to do this. Not just because God loves or hates any one of us, but because it is the very nature of God and existence. For cynical, disbelieving, engineers like me it takes a surprisingly long time to actually realize this.

Here's the thing, every one of us on Earth throughout history must play both the protagonist and antagonist, hero and villain, friend and foe. We are the ones who "write our own story" like that wonderful song from My Turn on Earth says, but who knew each of us is both a Jedi and Sith lord at the same time, Yin and Yang. I think I finally get it now. Let me see if I can explain this like an engineer.

It's physically impossible for light to exist without darkness. This is an observable universal truth. Sure there are shades of luminescence but even a gradient is impossible without the infinite extremes. Waves of all kinds have a crest and a trough, a place of high pressure and low. This is perhaps the most observable, self-evident property of all creation. Nothing can exist without it. All laws of science and spirituality are based on it.

Therefore, nothing can exist without opposition and contrast, no progress, no creation, no growth. This fundamentally means everything requires a catalyst. There can be no action without a reaction. Spiritually this means we all requires a source of pain to grow and progress. 

Here's the hard part, this means that _every single one of us is a catalyst for spiritual growth in others_ no matter how painful this universal truth is to accept. 

Let's look at some examples.

Loss of a loved one provides an opportunity for growth as we mourn the often unfair life taken so early and internalize our own mortality acting with more focus, passion, and commitment to make the most of the time we have left to honor that loss.

A excited girl dressed to party with her friend out on the town might not pay enough attention to avoid forcing an unsuspecting cyclist's face to smash into the the pavement breaking his nose and all his front teeth causing his jaded soul to see humanity in a new way as the unsung heroes of the ER and EMTs patch him back together helping him find his smile again, literally.

A man full of toxic subconscious pain might lash out at an innocent, unsuspecting, and dreadfully surprised person sharing the same roadway or bed for no obvious reason forcing them to face their own trials and trauma and ability to see past the hurtful anger to the person in pain underneath.

Growth requires resistance and trauma. It's not only a medical fact, but a spiritual one. Whether it is from adapting to and repairing micro-tears  in muscle fibers brought on through strength training, or being forced to ask extremely painful questions when others hurt us, willingly or otherwise. It is our response to the stress, resistance, opposition, and damage that propels us forward with growth and improvement.

Whether you anthropomorphize God or not, God puts certain humans through unfathomable trials composed of huge waves and storms not because God is an asshole but because God _is_ (the great "I am" as some traditions say). God doesn't just understands the vibrations of existence composed of waves with highs and lows, God _is_ those vibrations undulating through us all in every form, physical and spiritual. God is neither good nor evil and is both good and evil at the same time because without opposition nothing could exist.

Make no mistake. I am not justifying evil like some sort of existential cosplay. I'm merely pointing out the infinite nature of existence and suggesting how so many other humans have come to understand how evil and good can coexist. In fact, as the hippies would say, the more we can understand this the more we can help smooth out the cosmic storms and achieve a higher frequency, one less chaotic and painful. After all, the higher the frequency the smaller the distance between the highs and lows even though they always exist. When Calculus is applied we can take the limit of the distance between the highs and the lows to reach an infinitely sma

Why does understanding this matter? Because internalizing it as the basis of our own growth helps us accept the good with the bad and continue to progress. We stop seeing each other as friend or foe and simply actors in our own story. When we become blinded to this one fundamental truth and lose our own balance and ability to remain stable, wallowing in self-pity and remorse for the horrors of our time playing the villain in someone else's story, or losing ourselves to ego when our wave is at it's peak about to crest and crash.

The more we remember that this fundamental law of existence requires that each of us _must_ play the part of antagonist in someone else's story from time to time—usually outside of our full control—the more balanced we remain even during own our moments—yes, of failure—but also essential opposition helping another to grow from being that "bad guy" in someone else's life. And when we are flying high keeping this truth in mind reminds us that eventually, if not already, we are not just the hero but inevitably a villain as well. We are all protagonists and antagonists. Sometimes we are acting and other times reacting, but we are eternally caught in this cycle of Universal vibration. It is the very nature of existence.
