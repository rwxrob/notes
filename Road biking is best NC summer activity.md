After the divorce I bought a mountain bike but quickly learned that mountain biking in August is absolutely miserable. There's just no opportunity to evaporate all that sweat you build up in the humidity. You never get going fast enough but still have a ton of climbing to do so you sweat out everything you are wearing without evaporating which just makes your body sweat more. It's not fun.

The same is true for adventure cycling, never enough speed to ventilate and all the effort to haul around a whole bunch of stuff really slowly.

Paddleboading gets you near the water but unless there is a wind you are also still getting really hot and sweaty and by late August the water in the lake is as warm as a bathtub providing no refreshment for any kind of cardio activity.

Just forget about running or walking or hiking. You are poring sweat out so fast you cannot stay hydrate, let alone cool.

All of these challenges are not things that I faced in Utah, by the way, where *everything* evaporates almost immediately. This allows for all kinds of strategies for remaining cool including wearing a thing on your head and just soaking it so that it evaporates and cools you. In NC it would never evaporate at all and you'd just get even hotter.

Road bike, however, has the cure: speed. Even on a low-intensity training ride I'm regularly averaging 27 kph (17 mph). That's the wind of a very high-intensity fan blowing over your whole body constantly. This is the solution. Any sweat almost immediately evaporates including that built up from a grueling, slow hill on the descent after. Plus on the road out in farm land there are head winds and cross winds and tail winds to deal with. For training they are great for lots of reasons but in the Summer their
