I know it's heresy to question the biggest international trend in cycling, but I really want some random person to know they don't *have* to like gravel just because the whole world does. My half-gravel (all-road) rides to Charlotte and around Lineville Gorge have just completely solidified my opinion on gravel riding in general: 

- Gravel is only fun when there is less than 10% pavement, otherwise tire pressure woahs.
- Most gravel is just cross country mountain biking (2.1" tires most popular at Unbound now).
- Gravel is murder on a bike, even a gravel bike, and takes a lot more maintenance.
- Gravel riding often requires inhaling a ton of dust and pollen with all that "fresh air."
- Gravel riding often involves paved over washboard bumps and roots on "greeways."
- Gravel riding is harder on your body, tougher to recover from, and has less fitness gains.
- Gravel doesn't allow the speed and peloton skills of road riding.
- Gravel doesn't allow the fun of jumping and berms of flow trail and single-track riding.
- Gravel bikes are slower and geared worse than an all-road bike that will ride gravel.
- Gravel shoes have worse power transfer than road shoes.
- Gravel riding often involves muddy hike-a-bike, no one actually enjoys that.
- Gravel climbs have all the pain and none of the fun, downhill is too dangerous (many dead).
- I'm more likely to get shot on a gravel rideâ€”especially if I wear Lycra.
- Riding gravel often means being too far away from Uber or other help.
- Gravel only makes sense if all your roads are gravel around you.
- Gravel roads are not car-free, often the vehicles are way worse and drive more dangerously.
- Gravel riders are more invisible to the few vehicles that do pass them and very high speeds.
- Gravel riding involves far more angry dogs and union jack flags in America.
