I've finally figured out what I've been struggling to identify about my preferred riding style. I am a gravel rider who prefers mostly road and the occasional trail riding.

I do like my mountain bike for trail riding but only if it has flow and could basically be ridden on a gravel bike. Honestly, I absolutely despise rocks and roots. They are not funâ€”ever, not because I can't do them, because they just suck. Some people will call me a "pussy" for saying that and I'll just quietly think they are fucking morons. Jumps are fun. The occasional drop is fun (so long as you don't risk breaking you bacj. I could see how berms could be fun.

I love the culture of gravel riding that sits nicely between the MTB hardcore we-don't-do-lycra ethos and the lycra or die roadies who find their way off road eventually (like Lachlan Morton). I don't need a few seconds of aerodynamic advantage. I want comfort and the ability to walk into a pub without scaring everyone. However, I also want very high-performing power output from my pedals and gearing and frankly hate being bounced to death by gravel. Gravel and trails are a means to an end: to get out and ride with one strong requirement: *zero traffic*.
