Anyone who has played around with racing or competition in any way over the years knows that buying the best wheels possible for a best-of-the-low-end bike is always better than buying a top-of-the-line bike with stock wheels. This is the single main reason brands offer frames alone so you don't waste money on stock wheels that are *never* top of the line. (Yes, picking own components is a thing as well, but wheels are far more important.)

I've noticed that most age-groupers and club riders—even those who seem to have a lot of money to burn—don't seem to upgrade their wheels. Have a look for yourself, *very* few people you would ever meet in any group ride or local competition have top-of-the-line wheels. This means that if you know the secret (buy low-end bike with top-of-the-line wheels) you can dominate on _most_ competitive rides. It's like no one told them this secret and you can take advantage of it. Most rich casuals seem to just buy the highest end bike and keep the wheels it has. That's fine but still a huge waste of money when buying the high-end bikes because if you want to upgrade the wheel-set you are essentially throwing away those expensive stock wheels which cost way more than the stock wheels on a best-of-the-low-end bike (like my Domane AL 5 Gen4). 

I'll never forget when I bought carbon aero wheels for my Specialized Allez back in the 90s. It cost me $900 but oh my god. The difference was immediately obvious. Now I'm looking forward to doing that with my Trek Domane, but the cost of wheels has really gone up.

For example, the $3000 Specialized Roval Rapide CLX II wheel-set, which dominates the world of pro cycling, will do more for my speed on my top-of-the-low-end $2000 Domane AL than upgrading all the way to the top of the carbon frame list. Sure this wheel-set costs $1000 *more* than my new bike, but it will be so worth it.

For starters, the ultra cheap and heavy Bontrager Paradigm SL with cheaper hubs, spokes, and tires that come on my Domane AL are absolutely perfect to run 38c winter as all-road training tires. I can beat them up and never worry about them. Then, when I'm hunting KOMs or age-group podiums I can put on the Rapides and Lycra superhero power ranger suit and make crazy huge gains in raw speed, even in the wind or with the usual intense rolling hills here in Lake Norman.







By the way the all-around Roval Rapide CLX II is 1520g compared to 1265g for Alpinist CLX II, only 255g difference.
