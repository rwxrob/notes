I've collected what I think is a perfect bike collection for someone like me who wants above average amateur performance without breaking the bank and worrying too much about things wearing down or getting stolen.

| Use                    | Bike                   | Have |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ---- |
| Indoor racing/training | Wahoo Kickr Bike v2    | Yes  |
| All-road               | Trek Domane AL 5 Gen 4 | Yes  |
| Trails                 | Trek Roscoe 8          | Yes  |
| Long haul              | Salsa Marrakesh        | Yes  |
| Urban trekking         | Ghost Square           | Yes  |

The SL 5 is double the price of the AL 5 and only weights 830 grams less. Hell, if I cared that much about weight I would just bring one less water bottle or lose an extra kilo. It's not worth the cost. Besides putting that savings into better wheels will go a lot farther toward speed increases.

## Why no gravel bike?

Notice there is no "gravel" bike here. Most "gravel" riding that I would do is really just XC MTB riding that is better on a hardtail. Hell, Unbound had everyone running 2.1" MTB tires (which turn out to be faster than all their skinnier predecessors) and full (albeit light) suspension on their drop-bar "gravel" bikes. Just call it cross country already! Tour Divide has been won every year on an XC MTB bike.

When an XC bike seems like overkill and slows me down the all-road Domane running 38c Maxxis Ramblers is better than most gravel bikes—especially with the much better gearing breadth and depth. I drop most people riding gravel bikes on most gravel rides with light gravel but intense hills. The key is picking the right routes.
