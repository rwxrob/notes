Over the coming years I hope to build up a collection of the following bikes. Knowing this makes planning for storage and cost and maintenance easier now.

| Use                    | Bike                   | Have |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ---- |
| Indoor racing/training | Wahoo Kickr Bike v2    | Yes  |
| All-road               | Trek Domane AL 5 Gen 4 | Yes  |
| Trails                 | Trek Roscoe 8          | Yes  |
| Long haul              | Salsa Marrakesh        | Yes  |
| Urban                  |                        |      |

The SL 5 is double the price of the AL 5 and only weights 830 grams less. Hell, if I cared that much about weight I would just bring one less water bottle or lose an extra kilo. It's not worth the cost. Besides putting that savings into better wheels will go a lot farther toward speed increases.
