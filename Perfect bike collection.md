I've collected what I think is a perfect bike collection for someone like me who wants above average amateur performance without breaking the bank and worrying too much about things wearing down or getting stolen.

| All-road               | Trek Domane AL 5 Gen 4 | Yes  |
| Trails                 | Trek Roscoe 8          | Yes  |

The SL 5 is double the price of the AL 5 and only weights 830 grams less. Hell, if I cared that much about weight I would just bring one less water bottle or lose an extra kilo. It's not worth the cost. Besides putting that savings into better wheels will go a lot farther toward speed increases.

Notice there is no "gravel bike" here. Most "gravel" riding is really just XC MTB riding that is better on the hardtail. Otherwiws
