I've collected what I think is a perfect bike collection for someone like me who wants above average amateur performance without breaking the bank and worrying too much about things wearing down or getting stolen.

## No carbon frames

Carbon frames are super fragile and ridiculously overpriced for the benefit they provide. Just one spill—even just from leaning it wrong—and they are done. That type of fragility does not inspire confidence. Consider that the Domane SL 5 Gen 4 is exactly *double* the price of the AL 5 and only weights 830 grams less but could be dropped from a truck and have the frame land wrong on a rock and still be fine. Hell, if I cared that much about one kilo of weight I would lose an extra kilo of body weight or just get a better  wheel-set.
## Carbon road wheels

Speaking of wheel-sets. I've noticed that most age-groupers and club riders—even those who seem to have a lot of 

The all-around Roval Rapide CLX II is 1520g compared to 1265g for Alpinist CLX II, 255g difference).

It's not worth the cost. Besides putting that savings into better wheels will go a lot farther toward speed increases.

## Why no gravel bike?

Notice there is no "gravel" bike here. Most "gravel" riding that I would do is really just XC MTB riding that is better on a hardtail. Hell, Unbound had everyone running 2.1" MTB tires (which turn out to be faster than all their skinnier predecessors) and full (albeit light) suspension on their drop-bar "gravel" bikes. Just call it cross country already! Tour Divide has been won every year on an XC MTB bike.

When an XC bike seems like overkill and slows me down the all-road Domane running 38c Maxxis Ramblers is better than most gravel bikes—especially with the much better gearing breadth and depth. I drop most people riding gravel bikes on most gravel rides with light gravel but intense hills. The key is picking the right routes.
