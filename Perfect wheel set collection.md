I've managed to get my perfect, preferred collection of wheel sets turning my humble endurance bike into as much of a specialized bike that I need depending on events and conditions:

- Swiss Side Hadron2 Ultimate Aero + Conti 26/28c
- Stock Bontrager Paradigm SL + 
- Swiss Side Pion2 Aluminum  + Maxxis Rambler 38c
