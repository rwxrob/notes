I cannot even remember when the last time I had an acute, full body inflammation attack. There are many triggers, FODMAPs, allergies, and—especially—stress. It seems I've reduced or eliminated all of these things from my life over the last month and a half. My life, health, and outlook have never been better. I just want to take a moment to write down why I think that is in case I forget later.

- Better diet
- More physical activity
- Less stress
- Less visceral body fat
## Better diet

Changes to my diet deserve their own note. Suffice it to say, I drink mostly non-alcoholic beer and have more of a plant-based diet now. I do eat two hard-boiled eggs in the moring as well.

I turned down the fats, even the good ones, and upped the very simple carbs—especially rice and waffles.

Now that I'm adjusted to it, Huel is also a staple making sure I get everything but I have to only drink it in the early morning of after my ride since the oatmeal fiber in it does make me gassy (the number one indicator of intestinal distress from a particular food).

My main source of carbs and protein is rice and red or green lentils and whatever veggies I want to dice up into it. It's like a burrito bowl or curry bowl depending on the seasoning, but only _after_ a hard ride because the lentils (or any legumes) definitely do not play nice in my gut while on a ride. 

Popcorn popped in an oil popper with olive oil and no butter is my primary snack, along with gummy bears, and 70% chocolate. I do occasionally have a bowl or two of some sort of good cereal, but that has to be at night as well since my body doesn't like milk, even lactose free.

I've practically eliminated wheat products from my diet. I don't think I'm intolerant, but rice is so much better a carb source all around, which is probably why all pro teams use it as a staple of their training nutrition. At this point I'm personally convinced that Monsanto wheat is just bad for human consumption, period. I would venture that it is the single biggest trigger for inflammation and micro-allergic reaction of any main food ingredient in the world.

I only eat cheese sparingly and infrequently. Depending on the _type_ of cheese, too much cheese messes me up. I can eat at much Camembert as I want for some reason, which is good because it has been [proven to fight cancer and particularly strong bacteria strains](https://www.delish.com/food-news/a45545/cheese-could-kill-cancer-cells/) 

I won't freaking touch pizza in any form. It is just so freaking bad on every level. In fact, I've associated so much pain and suffering with it just the smell or thought of it makes me physically want to vomit (like college kids do with a flavor of alcohol after binging to much). I'd much rather have a burger, burrito, sushi, or pasta.

Overall, I feel like my body—especially my gut—has been reset to crave the type of foods that work best for three hours of physical activity per day. The long slow rides particularly clear my gut out completely since my body is looking anywhere for energy. I mean, I eat a _ton_ of carbs every day and never experience any form of shock or inflammation from it, at least, not any longer.

## More physical activity

I'm hard-code for endurance sports, always have been. Since riding 2-3 hours a day, fast or slow, everything has changed. I feel like my body is constantly thanking me, like a dog that finally gets take out for a walk. Endurance sports outside also increases the amount of good oxygen, vitamin D from the sun, and just sense of connectedness.
## Less stress

Being outside every day does more to reduce my stress levels than anything else. I have come to depend on being outside since I was boy as my primary way to deal with everything life has to throw at me. Something is so centering about being under the same sun, moon, and stars as everyone else on this Earth. I really do feel like it is a form of communion. It certainly is the most spiritual thing I do.

I've also significant reduced the number of responsibilities weighing on me during any given day—especially the self-imposed ones. The "don't get mad, get busy" mantra that drove me to obsess about saving the upcoming generations from poverty and misery by learning employable skills is now a thing of the past. It really is the end of an era—specifically of me livestreaming. Never say never. I have said so before and started up again, but this time it feels different. I have replaced livestreaming with _optional_ involvement in my local community in all sorts of ways. I've created Goblin Hunters for getting more casual but fitness-oriented cyclists out. I've been looking forward to attending cycling planning meetings. I've been spending time with close friends _in person_. It's not that I regret the livestreaming. I deeply miss those I met through livestreaming, but it's just not worth it. As much as I wish them well, it is more important for my health and wellness to build new relationships with people IRL who share my values and interests. I was completely unaware how much livestreaming mentality had crept into all areas of my psyche, suddenly I felt liberated.

- I can ride in the rain without worry
- I don't have to worry about getting ribbed for not streaming every day
- I don't have to answer questions, feign interest, or even talk
- I don't have pollen attacks from talking too much while riding
- I can ride trails that don't have mobile signal
- I save $3600 per year (the cost of a new bike or wheel set)
- I gain hours back in my life not setting up stream stuff
- I get _way_ more done whether it be writing or my lab
- I can focus on helping a highly curate group of legitimately interested people
- I can still affect change for those willing to actually read what I create (fuck the rest)

If I sound a little angry writing that list it is because I am. As much as I believe it was the right thing at the right time, I have come to really be angry with just where the state of "content consumers" has reached. In short, I would just rather not think about it. 

I have fulfilled my observation that the more likely you are to hear from someone, the less likely you are to want to hear what they have to say. I'm pulling a TJ Hallowaychuk, who hardly does anything for open source anymore, or more sadly, a Kris Nova who "just wanted to go climbing."

The throngs of mediocrity wanting to be spoon fed a better life, to be told everything to do, can languish and die for all I care. I've seen enough to know that these diseased people would refuse spoon-fed medicine and still end up dead. Many are too far gone or from abysmally bad places in life. Many are fighting debilitating neurological disorders and horrible life situations. None of it is my fault. I cannot save them. I felt like the captain of the Titanic when that mother comes in with her infant and says, "Please sir, there are no more lifeboats, what shall we do?"

Hearing about all the individual problems of every single viewer was just too much to take. I didn't start this shit. I didn't start the fire. It's been always burning and frankly, let the lazy burn. Amidst all the _real_ cases of people who need help there are the ultra lazy sloths and mixing them is a powder-keg of stress in my life. I don't give a shit those lazy fucking assholes who cannot tear their eyes away from some booba's breasts or brain-dead video game to help themselves and then _complain_ about it "being too hard." Fuck 'em.  Let's Darwin's law take effect. 

I resent many people who don't deserve it because of the few who tricked me into caring and thinking something in my power could actually help them. It worked at SKILSTAK because I _choose_ them. The Internet is full of idiots who are _not_ all of humanity and frankly never will be. The best part of humanity barely uses the Internet. 90% of those posting a comment are simply not worth listening to. I want nothing to do with these meme-worshipping incels blaming everyone but their fat, lazy selves for their problems—let alone help them to get gainful employment by doing the least amount of work possible. Most of them won't even do the work to read this note to understand these feelings. This is why I'm _never_ making a "why I don't stream anymore video." The non-lazy ones will actually read this and know. Let Darwin do his work on the rest.

After I restore my fitness, I do plan to eventually write books and blogs and stuff so the diligent will have something to find and perhaps I will stream occasionally related to that to promote it and find an audience, but ***I have no intention of regularly livestreaming ever again***. I mean it. The cost to my finances, health, and stress was *never* worth it. I've already cancelled all my IRL streaming accounts. Sadly, over the years, I have watched this same thing affect other well-meaning live streamers as well. And no, I will never be making a video about how to create the "best IRL streaming rig"

Aside from that, my wife and I have been sort of falling asleep with each other on the couch pretty much every night all cozy and snuggling together. This has been a good solid hour or more of Dopamine. Its almost like a date ever single day. I cannot overstate what a difference this makes in my stress levels. I'd figure it out if I didn't have her. In fact, I remember sort of comforting myself at night with a cozy couch and the perfect blanket and pillow. I prefer Doris, of course, but want to make sure that keeps happening no matter what. 
## Less visceral body fat

That fat from stress around the organs that is the hardest to get rid of and by far the most dangerous is also the primary source of chronic inflammation in most people. I still have a lot more of it than I would like, but by the time I reach 70 kilos it should be all gone, probably by July 24th (24 hours of booty) and even more likely after that (where I plan to ride 300 miles in 24 hours). 

I can *never* let that type of body fat ever accumulate on my body _ever_ again. Do you here me future, Rob! Don't do it. It's so easy to let it grow and so hard to keep it off as I age. This last two months have been particularly tough. I'm trying to be patient with myself, but it freaking sucks. It is so much better to _keep it off_ than to take literally years to get it off later.

I try not to judge, but when I see adults my age who have done nothing for decades to preserve their health it just makes me so sad for them. They must be so miserable. I was miserable with just enough weight to push me into the "overweight" category. It is an absolute disease epidemic in America today. I can't save the world, but I can save myself.
