I cannot even remember when the last time I had an acute, full body inflammation attack. There are many triggers, FODMAPs, allergies, and—especially—stress. It seems I've reduced or eliminated all of these things from my life over the last month and a half. My life, health, and outlook have never been better. I just want to take a moment to write down why I think that is in case I forget later.

- Better diet
- More physical activity
- Less stress
- Less visceral body fat

## Better diet

Changes to my diet deserve their own note. Suffice it to say, I drink mostly non-alcoholic 
## More physical activity

I'm hard-code for endurance sports, always have been. Since riding 2-3 hours a day, fast or slow, everything has changed. I feel like my body is constantly thanking me, like a dog that finally gets take out for a walk. Endurance sports outside also increases the amount of good oxygen, vitamin D from the sun, and just sense of connectedness.
## Less stress

Being outside every day does more to reduce my stress levels than anything else. I have come to depend on being outside since I was boy as my primary way to deal with everything life has to throw at me. Something is so centering about being under the same sun, moon, and stars as everyone else on this Earth. I really do feel like it is a form of communion. It certainly is the most spiritual thing I do.

Aside from that, my wife and I have been sort of falling asleep with each other on the couch pretty much every night all cozy and snuggling together. This has been a good solid hour or more of Dopamine. Its almost like a date ever single day. I cannot overstate what a difference this makes in my stress levels. I'd figure it out if I didn't have her. In fact, I remember sort of comforting myself at night with a cozy couch and the perfect blanket and pillow. I prefer Doris, of course, but want to make sure that keeps happening no matter what.
