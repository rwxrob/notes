The most amazing cycling shirt I've ever owned. Club Ride has long been my #1 favorite cycling apparel brand but after a three-hour run in the Go Long "sun" shirt I cannot overstate just how dialed in this company is to cycling values that I share. For me, the key to having fun on the long zone 2, base-building rides is absolute comfort and freedom to move and decide I just want to stop and get a coffee anywhere if I want. On the occasional long-haul adventure ride I want the same thing. This shirt gets that vibe absolutely, perfectly right.

Honestly, I don't know how they do it, but they managed to make a sun shirt that never feels clammy and sticky when you sweat in it (like every single sun shirt Patagonia makes, I'll never buy another). It also doesn't have the stiffness and tendency to wrinkle horribly like the traditional "fly fishing" shirts. It's simply perfect. It's so comfortable you don't really need a sweat-wicking sleeveless undershirt but you could.

Even the branding is absolutely perfect, hiding it in the rear shoulder making it way more understated. The western pattern with flap covered pocket looks great and keeps those pocket from filling up with air while riding. I'd feel totally comfortable wearing this to an art opening with Doris. And the slim flit is the perfect balance between Lycra tight and too much drag which also serves to make it have that fitted look when worn casually.

They even included a perfect zippered pocket for a snack and a built in cloth to clean my glasses with. I freaking love this shirt. I just wish they had it in more than only two colors.
