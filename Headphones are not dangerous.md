There is no basis in fact for the statement that ridding with headphones—or even ear plugs—makes a cyclist more dangerous or at risk than any other motorist, runner, or pedestrian on the road. In fact, they likely make most cyclists safer and probably protect the hearing of high-volume cyclists.

> Prolonged exposure to wind noise during motorcycle riding has been demonstrated to pose significant risks to hearing health. Research indicates that wind noise levels can reach approximately 90 dB(A) at 60 km/h, escalating to 110 dB(A) at 160 km/h. Such noise levels exceed occupational safety thresholds and can lead to both temporary and permanent hearing loss. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC539364

Wind noise when moving at pro levels every day is distracting and dangerous. Motorcycling studies about this are plentiful and conclusive and yet for cyclists it is against the law in some places to ride with headphones on. All serious motorcyclists know to wear special ear plugs while going on long rides and to get helmets that help. There's an entire sub-industry of ear protection for motorcyclists. Let's face it, motorcyclists are _far_ more dangerous to humanity than _any_ cyclist. Yet no one dares question their use of "hearing protection."

The perception is that for some reason riding a bike _requires_ more hearing capability than _anyone else outside on the road_. And yet, it is always the idiot on their phone or with their radio up or talking to the passenger who is the _actual_ cause of the problems I have witnessed on the road. Every single time it has nothing to do with the cyclist listening to music while riding.

One dude full-stopped in the middle of a busy suburban road to take a photo without any signals or anything. Trail people regularly do things with headphones in taking up the entire trail forcing me into the grass and dirt to get around them (one reason for an all-road bike) even though I am mandated _by law_ to provide "audible warning of passing." On the whole, the idiots out there are _not_ the cyclists wearing headphones. If anything, cyclists are the most attentive. People making cycling laws are as stupid as the people designing bike lanes and that will _never_ change in America. Cyclists will _always_ be at fault for everything that happens anywhere near them. It's the American way.

The actual truth is that wearing earplugs to block the wind and bone conduction headphones makes me a much safer cyclist. I promise you. I'm constantly rotating my head and glancing behind me with peripheral vision (helmet mirrors are freaking dangerous, a topic for another day). The peace of the music and no wind helps me focus on the ride and be more attentive—not less. Having super loud wind noise on a descent makes it impossible to think of anything else.

And another thing, I actually can hear everything that is super important to hear _better_ with my ear plugs in. That's because with the wind noise gone I can immediately distinguish the important noises, cars, sirens, even neighborhood kids laughing. The audible contrast is immediately obvious. 

I do lose the birds, however, which is why I do like using bone conduction head phones so I can remove the ear plugs and take in the birds when I slow down (usually on a climb). This also allows me to easily take calls from my wife or talk to a new friend on a ride. I just take a plug out and put it in my cargo bib pocket.

What kind of ear plugs? I prefer the super cheap silicon ones. I but the long handle off so that it doesn't conduct the wind noise rushing past my ears. Don't worry, I can still get them out easily (but if you try this make sure you have a solution for your specific ears). I actually tried the super amazing, molded motorcycle earplugs but they are expensive and I tend to lose them so I have just kept using these. When the are in they create a vacuum in the inner ear which sounds amazing. It makes my bone conducted music sound like it is playing in a room next to me but that's fine. I don't want the music super loud, just as a backdrop to the amazing scenery unfolding before me at cruising speed. It's absolutely glorious.
