Looks like a Goblin, right? This smooth, safe, scenic route has evolved over years of tweaking. It's all fun and fast suburban roads that are freshly paved and pristinely maintained. This is literally the best route in the area for 2-3 hours of serious daily road riding. Do it slow in zone 2 or as a sweet spot session with long intervals connected by casual segments ideally spaced for recovery and regrouping. Double it on the weekend to convert this Medio Fondo into an official UCI Gran Fondo (120km, 75 miles).
