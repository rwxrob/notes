Looks like a Goblin, right? This smooth, safe, scenic route has evolved over years of tweaking. It's all fun and fast suburban roads that are freshly paved and pristinely maintained. This is literally the best route in the area for 2-3 hours of serious daily road riding. Do it slow in zone 2 or as a sweet spot session with long intervals connected by casual segments ideally spaced for recovery and regrouping. Double it on the weekend to convert this Medio Fondo into an official UCI Gran Fondo (120km, 75 miles).

Go ahead, pull out the race wheels. They'll be safe. There are several very popular Strava segments on this route and, depending on the day, you'll likely pass one or two peloton group rides (although all the local groups choose routes that have unnecessarily bad trafficâ€”especially for a peloton where oncoming cars have been literally forced to veer completely off the road to avoid head-on collisions when peloton-passing trucks cross the double line on a blind turn).

On the few paved greenways connecting faster segments, please be sure to slow down and just enjoy the ride rather than terrifying the pedestrians, squishing a squirrel or a frog, and just generally giving all cyclists a bad image. In fact, remember to wave to _everyone_. You'll have plenty of opportunity for as much speed as you want after connecting to the next segment and you'll have a better CR/KOM chance because you'll be fresh.

The tunnel under the highway with its custom light show is particularly amazing. Many locals have no idea it exists. Now you do.
