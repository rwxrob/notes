When I started really weighing daily in earnest in 2020 I always tried to get my lowest possible weight. That's just stupid. I'm ashamed to admit that didn't occur to me until I changed my main [Garmin computer stats](Fitness/Essential%20Garmin%20computer%20stats.md) to use W/kg for everything instead of power. So what if it makes me slightly faster in Zwift. It's not realistic. Instead, I started weighing myself after drinking [the same amount of water and coffee and eating exactly the same waffle every morning](Fitness/Morning%20routine.md) (but before drinking a Huel shake because I don't always do that every day depending on what's on the training plan). This way my weight is more consistent and realistic. As soon as I started doing this it added a full kilogram to my weight reading and I was frustrated until I realized that is my *real* weight and my *real* W/kg. If there is going to be a margin of error it should always be on the higher side. It's always better to be faster than the W/kg that I look at every day than slower.
