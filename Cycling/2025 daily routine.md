After Cheaha I'm going to mix things up a bit with more focus on health and wellness and less on competitive cycling fitness. Most notably, I'm adding yoga back as my *primary* daily fitness routine with riding my bike as mostly a means to keep my heart healthy and body composition in check.

- 5:00 bike

Following is old but for reference:

I've modified my daily routine to matching ride times with sunrise during the warm months (May-July). This is also consistent with when most events happen. August and September I just shorten the training ride and push out when I wake up. This will help with early morning kit adjustments to offset the chill without weighing me down too much.

- 5:30 wake, pee, water, coffee, waffle, notes, void, weigh in
- 6:00 prep water bottles, gel flask, huel recovery
- 6:15 drive to shed, change, pump, lube
- 6:30 depart, start Garmin
- 11:30 back at shed, recovery drink, change, home, shower, start rice
- Noon work (small nap as needed during workday)
- ~7:00 eat, relax, hang
- 9:30 sleep

That's six hours of my day, every day but Sunday. There's not much left for work and family but I think I can make this work.

- 6 hours prep and training
- 8 hours sleep
- 7 hours work
- 3 hours chill

I can make up any missing work stuff on the weekend.

The hardest part of this is missing the morning work hours. We often have a meeting or two between 10am and noon. One of them I can actually take while on the bike ride because I just have to listen in. Others I have to be home for so will have to cut the ride on those days a bit short. Most of my work team work their hardest and most collaboratively from noon to six at night and sometimes work until 8pm my time. Since Doris normally doesn't come home until 7pm this works out fine and makes the best use of that time until she gets home.

Someone will look at the 30 hours of slow riding, 120 km per day, about  700 km per week and start to wonder what is wrong with me. This is nothing compared to people biking across America who average 70-130 km per day.
