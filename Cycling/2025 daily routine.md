I've modified my daily routine to matching ride times with sunrise during the warm months (May-July). This is also consistent with when most events happen. August and September I just shorten the training ride and push out when I wake up.

- 5:30 wake, pee, water, coffee, waffle, notes, void, weigh in
- 6:00 prep water bottles, gel flask, huel recovery
- 6:15 drive to shed, change, pump, lube
- 6:30 depart, start Garmin
- 11:30 back at shed, recovery drink, change, head home
