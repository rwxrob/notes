Besides the fact that even finding a place to pee is hard on a ride, there's the added bonus of being really hard to get out of those lycra bibs to do the peeing. Wouldn't it be great if we just didn't have to pee as much? Turns out understanding all the causes are useful to keep in mind. Recently, I was rather surprised that even though I drank more than before I did not have to pee like before. I set about my research to figure out why. According to my AI here are the major factors:

| **Cause**                     | **What’s Happening**                                            | **Fix**                                                 |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Well-hydrated              | You’re drinking enough (maybe too much for current effort)       | Slightly reduce water intake or spread it out more       |
| ⚠️ Low sodium intake          | Water isn’t being retained → body flushes it                     | Add more sodium to help retain fluid                     |
| ⚠️ Hypotonic drink            | Very dilute → triggers fluid loss                                | Make your drink slightly more concentrated (add sodium or carbs) |
| ❌ Too much volume at once    | Overwhelms kidneys → excess is flushed quickly                   | Sip regularly instead of big gulps                       |
| ❌ Cold weather               | Vasoconstriction → "cold diuresis"                                | Nothing to fix, just be aware it happens                 |
| ⚠️ Caffeine overuse          | Mild diuretic, especially in big doses or pill form              | Balance caffeine with sodium and water                   |
