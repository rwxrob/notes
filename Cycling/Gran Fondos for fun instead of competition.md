Yesterday during my test race pace ride for Cheaha, an upcoming UCI sanctioned event I had a lot of time and suffering to get me to ask the important question: Why am I doing this? My inability to immediately produce an answer caught me off guard.

If the question was more general "why am I riding my bike" then the answer is easy. I love it for all the regular reasons, being outside, seeing interesting things, getting my heart rate up, breathing fresh air, mooing at cows, occasionally racing cars in traffic, and, of course, staying healthy and skinny which lets me wear cool clothes. I know, oh so vain, right?

While I would enjoy that—and I frequently joke about it—that fundamentally isn't what motivates me. In fact, these events, if I'm honest, are more about being around people equally committed to improving their personal performance who also love riding their bike as much as I do. That's the appeal of Gran Fondos for me. I particularly like that there are timed segments and un-timed segments so you can—in theory—relax and focus on the parts that are timed.

Just watching the TdF reminds me that none of these riders actually get to enjoy a single site in this spectacular countryside.

Riding for performance—particularly in a peloton—destroys the appeal of one of the best motiati
