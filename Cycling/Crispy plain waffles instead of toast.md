For almost a decade a slice of almost burned toast was a staple of my pre-event meal combined with half a banana and a tablespoon of peanut butter. That meal led me to every PR I've ever made. I could eat it and do all the rest of event nutrition as liquid. It never got in the way of my full-gas Triathlon efforts, 10k, MTB or whatever. Almost two decades later, and with the help of AI, I now think I understand why.

The browning from toasting causes the Maillard reaction and a number of other transformations to the bread making it much easier on the gut for many people. Fermentation in the gut is practically negated completely meaning less FODMAP triggering. It also cancels out any residual yeast enzymes that can cause bloating. Think of a squished up ball of white bread compared to that same bread toasted. They have totally different digestive paths.

Given all of that, I now see why a crispy, well-cooked waffle with about a half table spoon of oil to the outer edges crisp up real well is one of the best carbs I can eat. I've tried the same with butter and syrup and it is a disaster to digest in comparison. Plain, however, these crispy waffles are one of the most digestible complex carb fuels I have ever used. Only plain write rice is better (and the preferred complex carb of most pro teams).
