Some people might see my Strava and wonder why so much, so often. The answer is rather simple but somehow not entirely obvious. Cycling saves me. I love my career as a code monkey but the side-effects that appear to be wonderful to anyone looking in from the outside are quite literally deadly. I've worked full-time from home for over 30 years and one truth has emerged: atrophy is real.

I have witnessed coworkers in variations of my profession literally die from this job. One had a stroke from sitting too much and getting a blood clot in his leg. Another died from a heart attack at 40. Countless others fight with perpetual pain and suffering from morbid obesity (a medical term), type 2 diabetes, and depressed mental states. The danger is realâ€”and subtle. People working in other professions know their lives are at risk on the daily. People in tech don't even think about it until it is literally too late.

Let's take my Strava as an example. For very good reasons, I stopped cycling and doing much of anything but coding and driving a car and eating horrible food on the road last May. I had built up a Strava power-based fitness score of 75 in the middle of March 2024. I weighed about 77 kilos, down from 94 in February 2023 (the largest I ever got in my entire life). By September all my fitness gains were gone. By January my weight was back up to 86 kg. Driving across the country back home in July with Covid was the low point of the year. 

I get maybe 200 steps around the house per day (not counting dog walks and the occasional errant to the store). I bet my daily caloric requirements would barely top 1500 per day and being healthy is obviously much more than consuming even the right calories per day. With that level of activity my body would atrophy to bed-ridden in months without something to counter it. I know because it's nearly happened to me twice.
