I'm going to attempt three days a week with nothing else on those days in the off season (October through February) and two days in season with a recovery ride that same day . More power please, which means as few reps as I can go. I also am only interested in doing  [half squats](Cycling/Half-squats%20are%20single%20best%20strength%20weight%20exercise.md) balanced with leg curls instead of a bunch of different leg things. There are tons of studies that show only half squats are needed for cycling power.

- 10 minutes gradually increasing difficulty on stationary gym bike
- 10 reps with just the bar (20 lbs) focusing on form
- 3x6 weighted barbell half-squats with split machine and bar pad for raw power
- 3x8 leg curls for muscular balance, not power
- 5 minutes comfortably high cadence to get legs back
- eat 10-25g of protein within three hours (2 boiled eggs, 300ml milk, etc.)

Weight should be 80-90% of 1RPM and always leave 1-2 reps "in the tank" (don't go until full exhaustion) in order to preserve muscle function and recover for riding.
