Here are my ongoing notes to develop a high-performance adventure cycling kit that can be used in October in North Carolina on the Mountains to Coast ride, which spans a variety of geographies and weather needs.

I love that the conditions on Mountain to Coast end up making these gear selections  work on a cross-country ride if I ever wanted to do one. I also love that I can overpack a bunch of other stuff in case I end up backing the wrong main stuff.
## Bags

- TailFin Aeropack  (carbon, no fast dropouts, no pannier mounts, $385)
- LeadOut bento box

This bag setup is 100% aero and covers everything that is needed. I cannot believe the difference compared to even bikepacking light panniers and seat bags. This is _so_ much simpler, lighter, and faster. I can go on all-roads I would ever want to ride with this.

> [!Take 'em on the plane]
> I can fly anywhere and rent a bike and add these bags to any rentable, endurance, all-road bike that exists. This means I don't have to meticulously pack all my stuff _and_ my bike and pray it doesn't get damaged in the process. Sure it limits my rides to those that have places to rent bikes and I have to either do a loop or catch a bus or train back but who cares. If I'm in an area where I cannot rent a bike there's a good chance I want nothing to do with that area of the worldâ€”especially in these uncertain times.
## Water

- Katadyn BeFree Tactical 1.0L Water Filter
- 500ml Elite x2 (or 750 depending on trip)

I'm never going on any trip where there isn't reliable water resupply. Sill, the one thing I never want to be caught without is water, even if a I know a resupply is only an hour away (I've had that happen before.) So carrying a filter my fastpacking bag is the default, always.

The 500ml bottles are just easier to get in and out and more likely to encourage me to use them instead of waiting. Plus I'm always carrying less extra water wait when water resupply is relatively reliable.
## Clothing

- ClubRide Go-Long shirt x2
- OrNot Mission shorts x2
- ExOfficio underwear (cycling length) x2
- MAAP Evade hat
- MAAP Alt_Road Legionaries  hat (removable sun shield)
- ClubRide ear cover hat
- Patagonia Nano-Air vest
- Merino neck gator, head wrap
- Merino socks x2
- Zero sandals OR Altair minimal shoes
- Specialized Torch 3 road shoes
- Gorewear Fernflow windbreaker
- Patagonia Dirt Roamer storm pants
- Patagonia Super Alpine jacket
- Giro Aether helmet
- Showers Pass Cross Point waterproof knit wool touchscreen gloves
- Patagonia Jackson Glacier down parka OR Patagonia Nano-Air hoody (sleep kit)
- Mountain Hardware down pants (sleep kit)
- Down booties (sleep kit)

This kit doesn't have a "casual clothes" option because all the clothes double as casual and performance, no lycra at all. Bibs make zero sense because they are hard to get out of, look weird, and only provide minimal aero gains over OrNot Mission shorts in reality.

Rain is absolutely brutal in NC so having serious rain gear is an absolute must. The discontinued Patagonia Super Alpine jacket is actually for climbing in the harshest conditions and has a hoody that perfectly fits over the Giro Aether helmet (another reason not to get an MTB or POC helmet and stick with minimal, lightest road helmets and just wear a MAAP cap under them when needed).

> [!TIP]
> I love that road pedals are completely rideable with sandals. Wanna be footloose on a hot day and just relax? Perhaps tan those ultra white roadie feet? Put on the sandals. It's okay. It's an advantage that very few performance adventure cyclists consider. You just cannot do the same with SPD pedals (unless you get those heavy double-sided ones).
## Sleep kit

- Mountain Hardware down pants
- Patagonia Jacskon Glacier down parka OR Patagonia Nano-Air hoody
- Down booties ???
- Big Agnes tent (actually water proof)
- Inflatable pad ???
- Inflatable pillow
- Sleeping bag liner

In North Carolina morning dew and condensation are _major_ considerations. A bivy really isn't an option at all if you want any level of comfort in the morning. When it rains, it _really_ rains so having a tent that is _actually_ waterproof and windproof is a must.

> [!Forget the sleeping bag]
> If you have a good tent, you really don't need a sleeping bag. Soldiers rarely use them. Sleep in your cold weather kit instead. This way you have your cold weather gear in case you misjudged the weather _and_ you are carrying less gear. In fact, you can actually ride while wearing it when absolutely needed. Try that with a sleeping bag. Plus, nothing is more cozy when the evening chill hits after a sweaty, all-out ride than putting on the down parka and pants. Plus, you can use the long length of the parka to change into other shorts without showing everything you have to everone. Others use a poncho or "river skirt" but that is a one-function thing that just takes up space.
