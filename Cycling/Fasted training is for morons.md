After dialing in my carb strategy and seeing the overwhelming positive results of taking in ultra-high GI carbs even during training rides I now see how completely stupid "fastest training" actually is. This idea that it will increase your body's tendency to burn fat as fuel is 100% unscientific. Guess what, you will _still_ use fat as fuel even taking in pure sugar as carb because that is the body's preferred system for doing so when the intensity is right. Rather than starving yourself on a training ride slow the fuck down instead. Ride at lower intensity to train the right energy system and _still_ take in carbs to keep the smaller percentage of energy required from carbs during that low intensity effort covered as well.
