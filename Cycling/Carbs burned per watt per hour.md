These numbers are the total watts burned per hour for a given level of effort. The body requires these carbs no matter what. If they aren't there you bonk, period. There are four ways the body gets these carbs:

| Carb Source        | Description                                                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üçû Ingested carbs  | Carbs from food, drinks, gels absorbed through the gut                |
| üß† Liver glycogen  | Stored glucose released to maintain blood sugar and fuel early effort |
| üí™ Muscle glycogen | Local energy stores in muscles used for moderate to high intensities  |
| üß¨ Gluconeogenesis | Emergency glucose from protein/lactate (minor unless extreme effort)  |
The human body only has three places to store glycogen (fat is another system):

| Storage Site       | Capacity (grams) | Energy (kcal)   | Notes                                                   |
|--------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| üí™ Muscle glycogen  | ~300‚Äì500g        | ~1200‚Äì2000 kcal  | Depends on muscle mass and training status               |
| üß† Liver glycogen   | ~80‚Äì120g         | ~320‚Äì480 kcal    | Maintains blood glucose; depletes faster than muscle     |
| ü©∏ Blood glucose    | ~5g              | ~20 kcal         | Very small; tightly regulated by the body                |

Here's how much is burned per watt per hour:

| Avg Watts | Total kcal/hr | Carb % of fuel ([^1]) | Carb kcal/hr | Carb g/hr ([^2]) |
| --------- | ------------- | --------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| 100       | 360           | 50%                   | 180          | 45g              |
| 150       | 540           | 60%                   | 324          | 81g              |
| 180       | 648           | 65%                   | 421          | 105g             |
| 200       | 720           | 70%                   | 504          | 126g             |
| 225       | 810           | 75%                   | 608          | 152g             |
| 250       | 900           | 80%                   | 720          | 180g             |
| 275       | 990           | 85%                   | 841          | 210g             |
| 300       | 1080          | 90%                   | 972          | 243g             |
Based on these estimates it's easy so see whether eating and taking on carbs through the gut is needed. So with a 270 FTP 200 average watt sweet spot effort burns 252g over two hours. That could completely empty the liver and start into muscle glycogen as well. But beyond this point recovering and topping off those glycogen stores for the next day becomes harder than taking in some carb through the gut during the effort.

Therefore, efforts typically less than 90 minutes can draw on stored glycogen and still be topped up through recovery and pre-fueling. *Any* effort beyond 90 minutes should always include taking in carbs through the gut in order to maintain performance or better recovery when training. This is where that "fueling "

[^1]: This is not completely accurate because it depends on how developed the fat oxidation energy system is, the better it is trained the less **Carb % of fuel**.

[^2]: Completely depends on gut training and absorption: 90-120g with a well-trained gut.
