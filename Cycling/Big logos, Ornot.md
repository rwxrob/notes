I cannot overstate my appreciation for the Matt and his Ornot brand and mission. Based in San Fransisco and with all the values that we need more of in the industry, I just want to buy all my cycling apparel from them from now on. Unfortunately, I don't fit into anything I would want to buy, just yet. 

Here's a recent marketing email I received from them:

>When I launched Ornot in 2013, it began as a modest project. I aimed to offer an alternative to my team kit plastered with "Muscle Milk" logos. Wearing those oversized logos felt awkward. My background as a graphic designer played a significant role in shaping the brand. A frequent client request I received was, "We love the design, but can you make the logo bigger?" From these experiences, the tagline for Ornot became obvious: "You could be a rolling billboard, Ornot.‚Äù Over the years, the trend of minimizing branding for a cleaner aesthetic has gained traction with some brands, and I wholeheartedly embrace it.
