Season goals:

- Qualify and finish Gran Fondo Nationals
- Complete body transformations enabling competitive 2026 season
- Finish a UCI qualifier in top 25% for age group
- An age group podium spot would be awesome

Training objectives:

- 300 FTP by July 4
- 40 minutes at 90% FTP after three hours by July 4
- 9% body fat by August 1 and maintain it forever god damnit!

Key training elements:

- Pro volume even though not shooting for pro events
- 1 hour weight training for power on the bike twice per week
- 30 minutes daily yoga focused on core strength and mobility
- One entire day off per week (nothing but yoga, cleaning, organizing)
- One 7-hour ride per week replaced by 2-3 hour recovery spin every four weeks

Note that I actually started non-specific training—almost entirely weight management and base training—second week of January. This schedule
