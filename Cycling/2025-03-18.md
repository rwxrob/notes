**Up base volume, maintain strength.** Now that my endurance has pretty much recovered from a Winter of coding instead of riding I can up zone 2 base volume to five hours per day working on fat-metabolism and training my gut on a new nutrition plan. I'll keep one day with strength interval hill bursts in the middle of a ride to help curb muscle loss, but I just have to accept I'm going to lose muscle during this phase more than I will after getting body composition back in balance. This means riding Goblin Gran (120km/75miles) daily with a triple on Sunday taking a full recovery day off as needed about every 10 days.

If I full this off for the entire month of March and April I'll be able to reward myself with a week entirely off just to enjoy time with family the first week of May. I feel like there's a good chance I will hit my body composition goals by then (70k, <10% fat).

When I come back in the second week of May I should be able to reset focus on higher intensity (strength and performance) and turn the volume back down to three hours on weekdays and six on one weekend day with one weekend day fully off to paddle board with wife and recovery fully.
