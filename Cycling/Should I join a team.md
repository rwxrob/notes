As much as I just love riding I would like to do some cat 5 rides and work up to cat 4 and 3. I just don't know if it would be worth it.  I am also considering some team rides and finding the right team with a focus on performance over fun. A team with serious commitment without taking themselves too seriously. I read the term "race craft" in one team description. That sounds perfect. I don't want to even attempt to join until I fulfill my own minimum body composition and performance objectives and custom team kit orders have already happened for 2024 anyway. That means 2026 really could be the year competitive riding and training. I am going to plan on being ready to apply for one or two teams by winter in order to winter train with them.
