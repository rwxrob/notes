The main reason I will be upgrading from AL 8 Gen 4 is for the better group set. You can't get an AL with electronic shifting, which is really too bad because I really would prefer an alloy frame to carbon.

- Manual shifting sucks on a Gran Fondo or typical road race (shifting fatigue is a thing)
- Fewer mechanical parts to vibrate around and be annoying, 105 mechanical is hella noisy
- Ultegra electronic is way better than mechanical 105
- Prettier bike color choices (SL 6 are god-awful ugly)
- Still an all-road bike meaning I can do Love Valley Roubaix with 38c gravel tires (not interested in anything but "light gravel")
- Carbon dampening might take some of the road chatter out
- The SLR has hydraulic brakes, carbon handlebars, better wheels, ways 2 kilos less than AL and 1 less than SL
- I probably won't need another bike later
