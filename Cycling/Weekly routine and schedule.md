Logistics, traffic, and weather are just ideal and predictable at that time. Afternoons are almost always rainy in NC. Before this it's still hasn't warmed up at all in the colder months but is still cooler in the hotter months. No school traffic as well. I can finish a five hour ride and still not hit school traffic that starts heavily around 2:30pm.
