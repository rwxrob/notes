Here is my *current* weekly schedule. It changes during the year somewhat but I'll make a note of it.

## 10 am departure

Logistics, traffic, and weather are just ideal and predictable at that time. Afternoons are almost always rainy in NC. Before this it's still hasn't warmed up at all in the colder months but is still cooler in the hotter months. No school traffic as well. I can finish a five hour ride and still not hit school traffic that starts heavily around 2:30pm.
## Pre-fueling

I've noticed that it is just so much easier to plan for rides during the week that do not require any on-bike fueling. I just make sure to top up every morning and the night before and vary the carb intake based on what is planned. Then I do all my gut training and on-bike nutrition on the long ride on Saturday.
## Century Saturdays

I'm really loving the 180km rides on Saturdays—especially while still shooting to reduce body fat to 9% or below. I might even keep them indefinitely because they are just so much fun. The only time they are not fun is when I get the gut-training and nutrition wrong but that's what these rides are all about. Every time I fail I learn something that doesn't work.
## Silly Sundays

Having no agenda whatsoever on Sundays has become a highlight of the week. I feel like a kid exploring whatever I feel like it. I'm more likely to say "weeee" going down the hills and doing "s" swerves down the street. Mostly I just absolutely love hearing my free hub because I don't feel like I have to keep the pressure on the pedals constantly like when training.
