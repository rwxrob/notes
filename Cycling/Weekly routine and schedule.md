Here is my *current* weekly schedule. It changes during the year somewhat but I'll make a note of it.

## 11 am departure

Depart at 11am most days so 11-1 weekdays. Logistics and weather are just ideal and predictable at that time. Afternoons are almost always rainy in NC. Before 11 is very cold and damp from dew usually. No school traffic as well. Since NC Mountains to Coast doesn't care when you leave I can plan on leaving around 11 am every day as well, which means sleeping in past all the chilly morning temps in the tent and just enjoying morning coffee. I've never understood why cyclists face the coldest part of the day in absolute darkness. I used to do it when I had young kids, so perhaps that is the reason. I was home to be with the family before most of them woke up.
## 40k standard length

40 km efforts are also easiest logistically and time-wise during the week. They are easily finished in under two hours. Since hydration and nutrition are per hour and per bottle that gives me two bottles to manage, 550ml or 750ml. The duration is less than anything that would require a complicated pit stop or refueling strategy. I can train those things on the weekend rides.
## Century Saturdays

I'm really loving the 180km rides on Saturdays—especially while still shooting to reduce body fat to 9% or below. I might even keep them indefinitely because they are just so much fun.
## Silly Sundays

Having no agenda whatsoever on Sundays has become a highlight of the week. I feel like a kid exploring whatever I feel like it. I'm more likely to say "weeee" going down the hills and doing "s" swerves down the street. Mostly I just absolutely love hearing my free hub because I don't feel like I have to keep the pressure on the pedals constantly like when training.
