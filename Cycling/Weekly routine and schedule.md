Here is my *current* weekly schedule. It changes during the year somewhat but I'll make a note of it.

## 11 am departure

Depart at 11am most days so 11-1 weekdays. Logistics and weather are just ideal and predictable at that time. Afternoons are almost always rainy in NC. Before 11 is very cold and damp from dew usually. No school traffic as well. Since NC Mountains to Coast doesn't care when you leave I can plan on leaving around 11 am every day as well, which means sleeping in past all the chilly morning temps in the tent and just enjoying morning coffee. 

I've never understood why cyclists face the coldest part of the day in absolute darkness. I used to do it when I had young kids, so perhaps that is the reason. I was home to be with the family before most of them woke up. Also it's cooler.

11 am means I'm likely going to hit the heat in the Spring and Summer that I need to get myself heat adapted as well.

## Pre-fueling

I've noticed that it is just so much easier to plan for rides during the week that do not require any on-bike fueling.
## Century Saturdays

I'm really loving the 180km rides on Saturdays—especially while still shooting to reduce body fat to 9% or below. I might even keep them indefinitely because they are just so much fun. The only time they are not fun is when I get the gut-training and nutrition wrong but that's what these rides are all about. Every time I fail I learn something that doesn't work.
## Silly Sundays

Having no agenda whatsoever on Sundays has become a highlight of the week. I feel like a kid exploring whatever I feel like it. I'm more likely to say "weeee" going down the hills and doing "s" swerves down the street. Mostly I just absolutely love hearing my free hub because I don't feel like I have to keep the pressure on the pedals constantly like when training.
