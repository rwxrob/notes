This recipe produces the fastest carb intake possible by the human body according to modern nutritional science. It fills one easy to carry and manage 250ml flask producing 250 grams of carbs in the optimal 2:1 Maltodextrin/Fructose split.

>[!TIP]
Unlike other recipes, I've eliminated raw glucose (like in light corn syrup) entirely which has a glycemic index of 100 versus Maltodextrin's 130 and makes it way too sweet. Even worse, the [osmolality](Osmolality,%20watch%20that%20isotonic%20limit.md) of corn syrup is ridiculously high compared to Maltodextrin which has the lowest of any sugar source. ***I only need 70ml (one swig) of water for every 20g of Maltodextrin (1/5th a mouthful of gel) for it to digest and not dehydrate me.***  If I was using anything *but* Maltodextrin I'd have to drink 380 ml—more than half a small water bottle—for that same 20g! This is why Gummie Bears, Jolly Ranchers, Swedish Fish, Sour Patch Kids, PayDay, and Snickers candy bars are all horrible in comparison. Those might have worked for boomer marathoners but not modern endurance athletes.

The secret of Matrodextrin's osmolality is the single biggest breakthrough in nutrition I've uncovered. I do a pull on the gel flask once per hour and decide how much by how much it fills my mouth ([my full mouth capacity is 100ml](Full%20mouth%20capacity%20is%20100ml.md)). Then I match it with three times more water. So 50g is half a mouth full followed by 1.5 full mouth fulls of water. This is super easy to remember and practice. If I need more than that I usually just increase the frequency of the same routine from once per hour to once every 45 or even 30 minutes. It also means that a single 750ml water bottle is exactly the right minimum amount of water to accompany a single 250ml flask. Drinking more water is certainly fine, less is not.

- 100 ml water
- 83 g Fructose powder (83 g)
- 178 g Maltodextrin powder (167 g carb)
- 12 g Key Nutrients Electrolyte powder (330 mg sodium, 750 mg potassium, etc.)
- ~ Morton Sea Salt (550mg sodium per 1/4 tsp)

>[!TIP]
>Don't add caffeine since taking a 200mg (NoDoze) caffeine pill or two at the right time is more strategic.

To mix this get a mixing bowl that has measurements to 500ml on the side but a little more capacity above that. Set it on a kitchen scale and clear the weight to zero grams. Make sure it has a handle and can be poured. Add the water at the bottom then add the electrolyte powder and salt followed gradually by the powders to fill the bowl. Slowly start to stir the powders into the water. It will liquify and reduce in size. Keep adding powder until it has all been liquified. Add more water as needed. When you are done mixing it you should have exactly 250ml and be able to pour it into a flask. Vary amount of salt based on expected sweat loss of event or training and how much gel per hour you are planning on taking in. Don't forget this is _per hour_—not total per flask. So for a 5-hour event with 50g of carbs per hour that's 5 times the "sodium per hour" listed. Thankfully salt is really compact and has virtually no impact on osmolality. Just one and a quarter teaspoons (2750 mg) is enough for most any event at that 50 g carb per hour carb rate.

| **Condition**                         | **Sodium per Hour** |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Cool weather / low sweat rate        | 300–500 mg          |
| Moderate sweat rate                  | 500–700 mg          |
| High sweat rate / hot / salty sweater| 800–1000+ mg        |
After mixed you can pour into a 250ml flask.

>[!TIP]
>Hold the bowl up high so that the stream of gel is smaller and fits though the hole. Or just use a funnel.

This makes enough gel to fill one 250ml flask. Double the recipe for two flasks (500ml is usually the capacity of most mixing bowls). That should be more than enough carbs for most amateur athletes for any Gran Fondo but check your personal [carbs burned per watt per hour](Carbs%20burned%20per%20watt%20per%20hour.md) based on your personal FTP. Most will be fine with just a single flask for anything under six hours (like the local group ride) if they've properly pre-fueled as well.

>[!WARNING]
>As good as this gel tastes. Don't use this gel to recover. The last pull should be at the top of the last hour of the event. The glycemic index is too high it will reek havoc on your system if your engine is just idling. It has to be revved up to burn this high octane. Use a protein + carb recovery drink (like Huel) instead followed by a real meal. Non-alcoholic beer works too.
