This recipe produces the fastest sugar intake possible by the human body according to modern nutritional science. It fills one 250ml flask producing 250 grams of carbs in a 2:1 Maltodextrin/Fructose split, scientifically proven to be the best balance.

Unlike other recipes, I've eliminated raw glucose (like in light corn syrup) entirely which has a glycemic index of 100 versus Maltodextrin's 130 and makes it way too sweet. Even worse, the [osmolality](Osmolality,%20watch%20that%20isotonic%20limit.md) of corn syrup is ridiculously high compared to Maltodextrin which has the lowest of any sugar source. ***I only need 70ml (one swig) of water for every 20g of Maltodextrin (1/5th a mouthful of gel) for it to digest and not dehydrate me.***  If I was using anything *but* Maltodextrin I'd have to drink 380 mlâ€”more than half a small water bofor that same 20g. That's more than half a small 550ml water bottle!

The secret of Matrodextrin's osmolality is the single biggest breakthrough in nutrition I've uncovered. I do a pull on the gel flask once per hour and decide how much by how much it fills my mouth ([full mouth capacity is 100ml](Full%20mouth%20capacity%20is%20100ml.md)). Then I match it with three times more water. So 50g is half a mouth full followed by 1.5 full mouth fulls of water. This is super easy to remember and practice. If I need more than that I usually just increase the frequency of the same routine from once per hour to once every 45 or even 30 minutes.
