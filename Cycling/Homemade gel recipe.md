This recipe produces the fastest carb intake possible by the human body according to modern nutritional science, costs almost _nothing_ compared to pro gels, tastes amazing, and makes nutrition management during a high speed race as easy as it possibly can be. This works *so well* I've been seriously tempted to keep it a competitive secret but I'd rather that everyone learn about it and try it themselves. This gel strategy doesn't require a bunch of overpriced annoying gels to carry, open, and throw away. It also frees water bottles to contain only water which significantly reduces the time spent to stop-and-fill at a feed zone. It also allows water bottles to be used for cooling, rinsing salt from eyes, angry dogs, water fights, cleaning wounds, or whatever. Oh, and you can adjust the sodium based on the amount of sweat expected.

This recipe fills one easy to carry and manage 250ml flask producing 250 grams of carbs in the optimal 2:1 Maltodextrin/Fructose split. For every flask one 750ml water bottle must be drunk for minimum osmolality (most will drink much more water than that, also syrup, honey, or sugary alternatives would require *five whole 750ml water bottles* to achieve the same osmolality).

>[!TIP]
Unlike other recipes, I've eliminated raw glucose (like in light corn syrup) entirely which has a glycemic index of 100 versus Maltodextrin's 130 and makes it way too sweet. Even worse, the [osmolality](Osmolality,%20watch%20that%20isotonic%20limit.md) of corn syrup is ridiculously high compared to Maltodextrin which has the lowest of any sugar source. ***I only need 70ml (one swig) of water for every 20g of Maltodextrin (1/5th a mouthful of gel) for it to digest and not dehydrate me.***  If I was using anything *but* Maltodextrin I'd have to drink 380 ml—more than half a small water bottle—for that same 20g! This is why Gummie Bears, Jolly Ranchers, Swedish Fish, Sour Patch Kids, PayDay, and Snickers candy bars are all horrible in comparison. Those might have worked for boomer marathoners but not modern endurance athletes. By the way, a "sugar flask" (popularized by some YouTubers) using granular sugar suffers the same osmolality problems and is horrible when compared to the same with Maltodextrin. This is why pro gels use it.



- 80 ml water (less is harder to pour into the flasks + better osmolality)
- 83 g fructose powder (83 g)
- 178 g maltodextrin powder (167 g carb)
- 12 g Key Nutrients Electrolyte powder (330 mg sodium, 750 mg potassium, etc.)
- ~ Morton Sea Salt (550mg sodium per 1/4 tsp)

This will fill about 1.5 250ml Hydroflasks. Each flask contains approximately the following:

- 67ml water
- 166g carbs (55g fructose + 111g glucose)
- ~700mg sodium, 500 potassium
- B12 and other various performance micronutrients

Drink at least three times as much water as gel each time you take some gel, no matter how much. This is the equivalent of making a carb drink with the same ratios but so much easier to adjust allowing only water in the bottles. The amount of

To mix this get a mixing bowl that has measurements to 500ml on the side but a little more capacity above that. Set it on a kitchen scale and clear the weight to zero grams. Make sure it has a handle and can be poured. Add the water at the bottom then add the electrolyte powder and salt followed gradually by the powders to fill the bowl. Slowly start to stir the powders into the water. It will liquify and reduce in size. Keep adding powder until it has all been liquified. Add more water as needed. When you are done mixing it you should have exactly 250ml and be able to pour it into a flask. Vary amount of salt based on expected sweat loss of event or training and how much gel per hour you are planning on taking in. Don't forget this is _per hour_—not total per flask. So for a 5-hour event with 50g of carbs per hour that's 5 times the "sodium per hour" listed. Thankfully salt is really compact and has virtually no impact on osmolality. Just one and a quarter teaspoons (2750 mg) is enough for most any event at that 50 g carb per hour carb rate.

| **Condition**                         | **Sodium per Hour** |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Cool weather / low sweat rate        | 300–500 mg          |
| Moderate sweat rate                  | 500–700 mg          |
| High sweat rate / hot / salty sweater| 800–1000+ mg        |
After mixed you can pour into a 250ml flask.

>Hold the bowl up high so that the stream of gel is smaller and fits though the hole. Or just use a funnel.

This makes enough gel to fill one 250ml flask. Double the recipe for two flasks (500ml is usually the capacity of most mixing bowls). That should be more than enough carbs for most amateur athletes for any Gran Fondo but check your personal [carbs burned per watt per hour](Carbs%20burned%20per%20watt%20per%20hour.md) based on your personal FTP. Most will be fine with just a single flask for anything under six hours (like the local group ride) if they've properly pre-fueled as well.

>[!WARNING]
>As good as this gel tastes. Don't use this gel to recover. The last pull should be at the top of the last hour of the event. The glycemic index is too high it will reek havoc on your system if your engine is just idling. It has to be revved up to burn this high octane. Use a protein + carb recovery drink (like Huel) instead followed by a real meal. Non-alcoholic beer works too.
