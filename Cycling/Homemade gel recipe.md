This will fill one 250ml flask producing 250 grams of carbs in a 2:1 Maltodextrin/Fructose split (scientifically proven to be the best balance). Unlike other recipes, I've eliminated raw glucose (like in light corn syrup) entirely which has a glycemic index of 100 versus Maltodextrin's 130 and makes it way too sweet. Even worse, the [osmolality](Osmolality,%20watch%20that%20isotonic%20limit.md) of corn syrup is ridiculously high compared to Maltodextrin which has the lowest of any sugar source. ***I only need 70ml (one swig) of water for every 20g of Maltodextrin (about a mouthful of gel) for it to digest and not dehydrate me.***  If I was using anything *but* Maltodextrin I'd have to drink 380 ml for that same 20g. That's more than half a small 550ml water bottle! The secret of Matrodextrin's osmolality is the single biggest breakthrough in nutrition I've uncovered.
## Lime

- 40 grams maltodextrin 1/4 cup
- 15 grams agave 2 teaspoons
- 1 tablespoon pure corn syrup
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
- 1/16 teaspoon salt
- 1/16 teaspoon Morton's Lite salt
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- 1 to 2 tablespoons of water
- 100mg caffeine capsule

1. Mix all ingredients except caffeine if using, in a liquid measuring cup with a spout.
2. Add one tablespoon of water at first and stir. I prefer my gels on the runny side so they are smoother to swallow so I add a second tablespoon of water.
3. Pour into a gel flask and add caffeine powder, if using.
4. If you have a FoodSaver, make 2 small gel-sized bags, stand bags upright in a glass, fill, add 1/4 tablet of caffeine to each gel if using, and seal without vacuuming. Mark a small tear line with a Sharpie near the top of the bag and make a tiny cut, being careful not to cut through the seal.
