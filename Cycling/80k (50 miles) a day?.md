I seem to be hitting a good rhythm with 80k (50 mile) rides per day. Riding that length in zone 2 takes about three hours. 
I've tried five hours of low-intensity and it is just too much stress and lost time. It's actually at least six hours a day for cycling and recovery. Add 7-8 hours of work and there is very little left of the day for anything else at all. 

While I'm still deciding how competitive to get for 2026 I do know that I pretty much need to ride 80k per day to maintain base health and fitness since I have a remote day job working literally from my bedroom (where I also have a desk).

If I want to boost my FTP or sprint I can up the intensity for some intervals and mix in recovery taking slightly less time.

Three hours is really the most time I can spend on anything during a week day if I want to have any sort of life outside of cycling. Many would say that is even too much.

Part of the time lost is the hour-long nap required even for this level of training to get a solid recovery. At my age this is mandatory no matter what else is going on. I'm absolutely useless to everyone without it. Unfortunately, that is only going to get worse. Without the training I *still* often need a nap just to have the cognitive ability to do the basics of my job.

I can double up on Sundays to ride an ultra-century if the weather is nice to get all of Monday off.

80k a day is also a nice leisurely pace to cross the country by bike, which I still haven't ruled out doing at some point. 

In 2026, however, I might well end up riding 40k (25 miles) per day instead and just alternating the intensity with a lot more sweet spot work. 90 minutes is trivial to manage when it comes to a bike ride. Managing water and nutrition also gets trivial, too trivial. I would need to be sure and do long rides on the weekends to manage logistics and nutrition.

If I move to 40k, however, I can also add back daily morning yoga for an hour, which I really want to add back. I remember I got back into yoga after running immediately after I woke up fasted. When I do it again it will be in the morning after drinking coffee and journaling a bit. Then I can ride in the afternoon when its the warmest in the winter. Hell, I could even start doing that again now. Yoga in the morning. Bike ride at night. That way I have my day wrapped in physical activity and plenty of recovery time between.
