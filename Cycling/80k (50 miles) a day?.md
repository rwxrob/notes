I seem to be hitting a good rhythm with 80k (50 mile) rides per day. 

While I'm still deciding how competitive to get for 2026 I do know that I pretty much need to ride 80k per day to maintain base health and fitness since I have a remote day job working literally from my bedroom (where I also have a desk). Riding that length in zone 2 takes about three hours. 

If I want to boost my FTP or sprint I can up the intensity for some intervals and mix in recovery taking slightly less time.

Three hours is really the most time I can spend on anything during a week day if I want to have any sort of life outside of cycling. Many would say that is even too much.

Part of the time lost is the hour-long nap required even for this level of training to get a solid recovery. At my age this is mandatory no matter what else is going on. I'm absolutely useless to everyone without it. Unfortunately, that is only going to get worse. Without the training I *still* often need a nap just to have the cognitive ability to do the basics of my job.

I can double up on Sundays to ride an ultra-century if the weather is nice to get all of Monday off.

I've tried five hours of low-intensity and it is just too much stress and lost time. It's actually at least six hours a day for cycling and recovery. Add 7-8 hours of work and there is very little left of the day for anything else at all.

80k a day is also a nice leisurely pace to cross the country by bike, which I still haven't ruled out doing at some point.
