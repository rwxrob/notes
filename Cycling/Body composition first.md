Power does not matter if I'm hauling 15% more body mass than the competition. All the pros prove this over and over. In fact, wanna get fast immediately in Zwift which *only* looks at watts per kilo? Lose weight.

It's super easy to get sucked into all the hype and media out there related to competitive cycling that applies to trained riders with under 10% body fat. Pros like Tadej have 5% and weigh 68 kilos even though they are 175cm tall. The Cyclist's Training Bible and Coggins stuff, all of it assumes a level of fitness that most people coming to cycling just won't have—even if they had it at one time during their live. There is almost zero discussion of what a person with an "overweight" BMI can do, not a chapter discusses this at all. 

The assumption is always that the person looking to train for performance already has a normal amount of fitness and body fat. It can make people who have never had that—or lost it—feel excluded and ignored. This is exacerbated by pros making jokes about [MAMILs](MAMIL%20-%20Middle-Age%20Men%20In%20Lycra.md) who actually are doing really well given all that life demands of them outside of their "hobby" no matter how passionate they are.

I've witnessed this subtle but perceptible dynamic at many group rides and events in the past. People wearing lycra are already of a particular mindset when it comes to fitness and judgement in general. It's like walking into a Gold's Gym with a typical competitive cyclist body. As much as I don't care for it, it's just human tribal nature to do so. People gravitate toward others with similar personalities, passions, and, yes, physical characteristics.
