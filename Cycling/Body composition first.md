Power really does not matter when hauling around 20% more body mass than the competition. It's not just watts. It's watts *per kilo*. For most mere mortals working on the "per kilo" is faster and safer than working on the watts at first. It seems obvious but with all the passion and hype to get good its worth a reminder. I know I need it.

At the end of the day it's just physics. Apply the same force to something that weighs less and it will travel faster. This is obviously why horse-racing jockeys and cycling classics pros like Tadej have 5% body fat and weigh 68 kilos even though they are 175 cm tall. And yes, someone that small can actually produce the same force as a swole person double that size

But most people are not anywhere close to those numbers when they pick up cycling. It's super easy to get sucked into all the hype and media out there related to competitive cycling that applies to trained riders with under 10% body fat—especially for those who *once were* competitive endurance athletes and have lost their way, like me. We immediately focus on everything about power and intensity to increase our power to get fast when, in fact, that intensity might just be making us even slower.

Cortisol, produced by stress, makes you fat in the worst way. It produces visceral body fat around the organs that directly causes inflammation and inhibits healing and recovery.  Cortisol also tanks testosterone production which is catastrophic for older riders who already struggle with T production from their youth. 

Guess what causes the most cortisol production? You guessed it: intensity. All those videos about increasing intensity, strength training, and performance don't ever mention the high-paid sports medical professional who takes *daily* blood samples of the pros during training to ensure that the levels of cortisol don't increase and T decrease. The average person passionate about getting good is *not* going to get that right, ever. Instead, they are going to overtrain, flood their system with cortisol, get fat, frustrated, and give up.

The Cyclist's Training Bible and Coggins stuff, all of it assumes a level of fitness that most people coming to cycling just won't have—even if they had it at one time during their live. There is almost zero discussion of what a person with an "overweight" BMI can do, not a chapter discusses this at all. Why? Because that topic is rather boring and won't get any media attention or accolades.

The assumption is always that the person looking to train for performance already has a normal amount of fitness and body fat. It can make people who have never had that—or lost it—feel excluded and ignored. This is exacerbated by pros making jokes about [MAMILs](MAMIL%20-%20Middle-Age%20Men%20In%20Lycra.md) who actually are doing really well given all that life demands of them outside of their "hobby" no matter how passionate they are.

I've witnessed this subtle but perceptible dynamic at many group rides and events in the past. People wearing lycra are already of a particular mindset when it comes to fitness and judgement in general. It's like walking into a Gold's Gym with a typical competitive cyclist body. As much as I don't care for it, it's just human tribal nature to do so. People gravitate toward others with similar personalities, passions, and, yes, physical characteristics.
