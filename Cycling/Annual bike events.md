Love the[ Gran Fondo national series](https://www.granfondonationalseries.com/gfns-events-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

Love https://ncsports.org/ and their supported cycling events.

Events I've done and removed:

- 24 Hours of Booty ($450) (July, raising money to fight cancer but so boring even with everything they add)
- RAIN ($80) - non-competitive (July, conflicts with Gran Fondo Asheville, travel required)
