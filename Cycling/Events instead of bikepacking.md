I get the appeal of bikepacking but I was looking over my [annual bike events](Cycling/Annual%20bike%20events.md) and wondering where I would put bikepacking if I wanted to do it. Then I realized I don't *really* want it. The logistics and "adventure" actually distract from the pure joy of riding. Organized, supported events are always better for that. Sure I'll always have the option but my year is so completely full with fun competitive events interspersed with recreational fully-supported ones that are extremely scenic and social that I don't need to plan any bikepacking at all. Compared to solo bikepacking on busy connecting roads or bringing my bear spray I prefer not. I do like to get out into nature by myself, for sure, but not that much. In fact, too much camping and bikepacking would actually lose a lot of hard-earned gains made from regular training. So as long as I want remain competitive for Gran Fondo National Series—my main goal—then the fun stuff had better align with those
