I get the appeal of bikepacking but I was looking over my [annual bike events](Cycling/Annual%20bike%20events.md) and wondering where I would put bikepacking if I wanted to do it. Then I realized I don't *really* want it. The logistics and Sure I'll always have the option but my year is so completely full with fun competitive events interspersed with recreational scenic ones that I don't need to plan any bikepacking at all.
