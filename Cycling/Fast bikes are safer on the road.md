I once purchased a scooter to commute to work in Arizona. I took it back and got a motorcycle instead. Why? Because the scooter was just so dangerous. I could not keep up with traffic so cars had to constantly pass me at high speed. With the motorcycle I could pass them if I wanted.

The same goes for road bikes. When on my slow, long-haul Salsa loaded down so that pushing 250w only gets me about 15kph there is no way I can maneuver around or keep up with traffic. I'm completely at the mercy of the traffic. On my minimal, speedy Domane averaging 30kph on the flats, however, I very frequently exceed the traffic on my route and can often use the traffic to my advantage or get around it. My average speed allows me to merge easily with traffic and just appear more like an actual vehicle instead of an obstacle to be dealt with.
