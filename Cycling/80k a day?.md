I seem to be hitting a good rhythm with 80k (50 mile) rides per day. 

While I'm still deciding how competitive to get for 2026 I do know that I pretty much need to ride 80k per day to maintain base health and fitness since I have a remote day job working literally from my bedroom (where I also have a desk). Riding that length in zone 2 takes about three hours. 

80k a day is also a nice leisurely pace to cross the country by bike, which I still haven't ruled out doing at some point. 

If I want to boost my FTP or sprint I can up the intensity for some intervals and mix in recovery taking slightly less time.

Three hours is really the most time I can spend on anything during a week day if I want to have any sort of life outside of cycling. Many would stay that is even too much.

I can double up on Sundays to ride an ultra-century if the weather is nice to get all of Monday off.
