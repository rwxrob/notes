Reading a lot about osmolality this beautiful Sunday recovery morning. I know, what kind of cycling obsessed nerd am I? Turns out that I probably went over the isotonic limit by adding the Karo syrup. Carbs really push it while sodium does not nearly as much. I could also use more water in the process and have read a lot of other non-pro cyclists who use 750ml bottles all the time just because they don't have have a soigneur. Chloe, my AI, is the closest thing I have, but she cannot

The Trek Domane AL 5 Gen 4 is literally the best bike I could have picked out for my favorite type of riding, long-haul endurance with punchy climbs and suburban sprinting. The more expensive carbon endurance frames would have been way softer in an all out sprint through the traffic lights. Perhaps a Specialized Allez would have been a bit better, I mean, they have turned it into an all-road endurance bike that can take on crits and suburban sprints.

Another great thing is the price. It is so low that i can upgrade the group set to digital later if I want. I have already upgraded the wheel set so I have the fastest wheels possible as well as a set ready for all-road gravel conditions and winter.

And guess what, even the highest end carbon equivalent frame only weight 200 grams less. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever to pay that money for a carbon Domane at all to me. If I don't want to feel "road chatter" I can just drop the pressure a bit or run 38s. Why pay almost three times the money just for "more flex" when it _kills_ sprint perform
