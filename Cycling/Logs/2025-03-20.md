Today I plan on getting out for a recovery ride while it is still warm. Should take about three hours.
## Kit

- New grey ClubRide Go-Long (now I have both of them)
- Sleeveless wicking undershirt
- Breaking in new NeoPro black cargo bibs
- MAAP Evade cap (so glad I did, saved me from hypothermia I swear)
- Specialized Torch 2
## Report

| Distance | Elevation | Time    | NPower | TSS | Route        |
| -------- | --------- | ------- | ------ | --- | ------------ |
| 61.35    | 631       | 2:58:06 | 134    | 100 | Goblin Medio |

Ride started at 25C and dropped to 13 by the end with 30kph winds _on average_. It was brutal. I started in thermal tights and went back and changed to bibs because they were too hot. Boy did I regret that. Here's what I learned:

- 2 550 ml water bottles with two scoops electrolyte each was perfect
- Only ate about a dozen gummies total for the ride and was strong whole way
- Sips were a bit too big every 15 minutes making me want to pee before the end
- Winds blew me around like a leaf making me rethink deep rim aero wheels
- Putting off high-end deep rim wheels until at least 2026
- Realized I really do need to get into the gym to up my power
- Saw a Strava dude pushing 250 for two hours and only getting 45 TSS (that would kill me)
- Go-Long doubled sleeve layer on top of arms is completely brilliant!
- New stats display on Garmin really working

Here are the essential Garmin stats I have and why:

1. 10 second power - best indication of power trend, smooths spikes and recoveries
2. Normalized power - best indicator of how hard been going all ride so far
3. Cadence - good sanity check that I glance at when seeing other things
4. Duration - when to drink and eat and if I'm going to make it before a sunset
5. Distance - how much left do I have, perfect when riding same loop daily
6. Temperature - when to pull out the windbreaker, helps tweak kit selections
7. Speed - vanity stat really, hardly ever relevant, would be in a race

I do not have heart rate because I hate wearing that shitty strap. I've written a lot about how valuable HR is and I still believe that. Riding the same loop every day, however, allows me to make all the decisions I need while riding based on all these other stats instead. This really helps me dial in my actual PE better. I never want to be looking at my stats during a race anyway, unless it is perhaps on a break away, but even then.
