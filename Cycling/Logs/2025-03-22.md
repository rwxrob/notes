Stayed up until 2am last night waiting for my wife to get home. Huge mistake. It killed recovery from yesterdays ride ~~so just a slow recovery ride today, (130-150 power). No punching hills. Going to try and do some light cleaning and organizing as well.~~ Forget that, the weather was so good I rode a century instead, lol.

- *Took seat up 1cm, this feels absolutely perfect*
- Felt a bit of momentary pain in both knees at different times, probably adapting, went completely away
- Feel like I totally nailed this century even though want to speed up later
- Really conservative first lap
- A few punchy climbs allowed second lap
- Tested "fatigued" final sprints on third lap
- Nutrition was really dialed in, I think sodium is what I was lacking enough of for a very long time
- My gut is well trained for Huel, but the water makes me have to pee, need to think about that, bars?
- My gut is also well trained for rice and lentils, wonder if I could make rice balls
- Every time legs felt spend a swig of electrolyte recovery made it go away, but no carb in it

## Thoughts

For years I thought CytoMax was magical because it didn't produce Lactic Acid and now I'm thinking it was just the added sodium that thwarted the pain and leg soreness.
