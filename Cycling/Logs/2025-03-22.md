Stayed up until 2am last night waiting for my wife to get home. Huge mistake. It killed recovery from yesterdays ride ~~so just a slow recovery ride today, (130-150 power). No punching hills. Going to try and do some light cleaning and organizing as well.~~ Forget that, the weather was so good I rode a century instead, lol.
