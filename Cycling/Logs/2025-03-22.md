Stayed up until 2am last night waiting for my wife to get home. Huge mistake. It killed recovery from yesterdays ride ~~so just a slow recovery ride today, (130-150 power). No punching hills. Going to try and do some light cleaning and organizing as well.~~ Forget that, the weather was so good I rode a century instead, lol.

- *Took seat up 1cm, this feels absolutely perfect*
- Felt a bit of momentary pain in both knees at different times, probably adapting, went completely away
- Feel like I totally nailed everything about this century, need to use as a model for others
- Really conservative first lap
- A few punchy climbs allowed second lap
- Tested "fatigued" final sprints on third lap
- Nutrition was really dialed in, I think sodium is what I was lacking enough of for a very long time
- My gut is well trained for Huel, but the water makes me have to pee, need to think about that, bars?
- My gut is also well trained for rice and lentils, wonder if I could make rice balls
- Every time legs felt spend a swig of electrolyte recovery made it go away, but no carb in it
- Acute pain in both feet from fatigue and circulation stress after sprinting while fatigued, gone 10 minutes after end
- Feel like endurance (Fondo specifically) might be my thing to focus on over GC, sprinting, climbing
- Trying to decide if one century a week is a good goal or not
- Trying to decide is aero or climbing wheel set would be better for overall goals

## Thoughts

For years I thought CytoMax was magical because it didn't produce Lactic Acid and now I'm thinking it was just the added sodium that thwarted the pain and leg soreness. I'm not convinced that typical leg burn is caused by lactic acid build up at all. In fact, a bit of research with ChatGPT help confirms that lactic acid as a cause is a well-believed myth.
