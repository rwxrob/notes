I am starting to write a log every day to get out all the thoughts and tweaks so I don't forget them later. I might someday put this on Strava as a post. We'll see. Perhaps someone else could benefit. I could just link to my socials and include these notes and log in there. Ooo, what if I made a `log` under Cycling? I'm totally doing that. The truth is I prefer writing to making videos or podcasts. Just more enjoyable for me. I must have got that from my mother. She has always used writing as therapy.
## Plan

- 16C high, no wind, clear -  so test new thermal tights
- Still to much love handle to wear lycra tops and maintain my self-respect - so ClubRide Go-Long (again)

## Outcome
