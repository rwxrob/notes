Today I plan to just enjoy the ride again. Will bump to Zone 2 which should keep me warmer in the same kit as yesterday since temps are suppose to be stable, no wind, and sunny. Starting at 3:30 I should finish with plenty of sun and heat left. Tomorrow planning a Goblin Gran (2xloop) so going easy for now. I think I'll try the bone conducting headphones today.

- Absolutely nailed kit for conditions
- Music was far better than I thought it would be
- Heightened seat by 1 cm, definitely needed that, possible one more still
- Felt unusually strong, not completely sure why, probably seat adjust
- I think Zyrtek was main cause of performance drop two days ago
- Danced up all the hills focusing on dancing form ðŸ˜Ž
- Stopped for lemonade at stand in last 20k
- First time changing in bike shed unit itself (closed door half way)
- Attempted use of Patagonia Parka as changing shield failed, need another option
- Got out of riding clothes immediately while body core temp still high
- DKLEIN Lactic Acid pull-over hoody is so plush after changing out
- Vulcan skater shorts baggy and warm, but something full leg would be better post ride
- Patagonia Parka far too hot to wear post ride, pull-over hoody was much better
- Starting to get annoyed by MAAP Evade cap cutting out vision when in tuck
- Bought a MAAP Equalize cap to compare with the Evade
- I'm guess Evade has better sun protection for more upright riding, but cap will win in aero
