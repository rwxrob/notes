Today I plan to just enjoy the ride again. Will bump to Zone 2 which should keep me warmer in the same kit as yesterday since temps are suppose to be stable, no wind, and sunny. Starting at 3:30 I should finish with plenty of sun and heat left. Tomorrow planning a Goblin Gran (2xloop) so going easy for now. I think I'll try the bone conducting headphones today.
