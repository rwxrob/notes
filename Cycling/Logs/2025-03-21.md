Today I plan to just enjoy the ride again. Will bump to Zone 2 which should keep me warmer in the same kit as yesterday since temps are suppose to be stable, no wind, and sunny. Starting at 3:30 I should finish with plenty of sun and heat left. Tomorrow planning a Goblin Gran (2xloop) so going easy for now. I think I'll try the bone conducting headphones today.

- Absolutely nailed kit for conditions
- Hardly 
- Music was far better than I thought it would be
- Heightened seat by 1 cm, definitely needed that, possible one more still
- Felt unusually strong, not completely sure why, probably seat adjust
- I think Zyrtek was main cause of performance drop two days ago
- Danced up all the hills focusing on dancing form ðŸ˜Ž
- Stopped for lemonade at stand in last 20k
- First time changing in bike shed unit itself (closed door half way)
- Attempted use of Patagonia Parka as changing shield failed, need another option
- Got out of riding clothes immediately while body core temp still high
- DKLEIN Lactic Acid pull-over hoody is so plush after changing out
- Vulcan skater shorts baggy and warm, but something full leg would be better post ride
- Patagonia Parka far too hot to wear post ride, pull-over hoody was much better
- Starting to get annoyed by MAAP Evade cap cutting out vision when in tuck
- Bought a MAAP Equalize cap to compare with the Evade
- I'm guess Evade has better sun protection for more upright riding, but cap will win in aero
- Added [Favorite cycling kit brands](../Favorite%20cycling%20kit%20brands.md)

## Thoughts

I couldn't help but think how absolutely perfect my Goblin Medio loop is but how much others might find doing the exact same loop every day to be boring. 

Sometimes I feel a little ashamed at the lack of variety on my Strava activities list. I regularly see Strava people doing something new and exciting every day and I definitely get the appeal but for some reason that doesn't appeal to me at all right now.

One Strava guy did several loops of the relatively short "peanut" in Huntersville, at 5:30 AM in the dark no less. He is 100% focused on training for podium performance and I totally get it. That was definitely me in my 20s and 30s (even though I never actual got one, damn Mormons took all my time and money). I am kinda like that, but with a much bigger regular loop, Goblin Medio. Two laps for me is a Gran Fondo. Three-ish is a century.

The comfort of not thinking about the logistics of the ride _at all_ frees me entirely to think about the _quality_ of the ride and the subtle but amazing things that change from day to day on the same safe, regular route. At 60 kilometers there is always something new and interesting to see on every single ride even if I've ridden over the exact same stones embedded in asphalt hundreds of times at this point.

I also heard Simon from GCN lament a little ashamedly that he too always rides the same favorite loop, but he's still one of the best performance of that bunch.

As usual, I think it is a balance between enjoying the ride and including a high performance loop every once in a while. That way I get the best of the "professional training" focus without losing the fun of the actual ride itself. It's sort of like pushing while enjoying instead of just suffering. One thing is for sure. I enjoy it so much this way I look forward to it every single day (and write about it for hours when *not* riding it). Eventually, I'll add in some Mountain Creek Park flow MTB rides for fun. For now, I'm going to keep with this until I hit my fitness goals.
