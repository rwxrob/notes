I am starting to write a log every day to get out all the thoughts and tweaks so I don't forget them later. I might someday put this on Strava as a post. We'll see. Perhaps someone else could benefit. I could just link to my socials and include these notes and log in there. Ooo, what if I made a `log` under Cycling.
## Plan

- 16C high so test new thermal tights

## Outcome
