Today I'm going to ride the LKN Medio Fondo loop for recon instead of Goblin. Yesterday was the first day I can remember in the last three years since my return to cycling that I was notably annoyed by the limitations of stopping and riding on greenways. I know. I'm Mr. Goblin Hunter, but who says I have to be? I do find Goblin to be so enjoyable, so much of visual interest, absolutely no worries, and just enough of every type of riding that I like on pavement to keep it really fun. It really is like "Zwift for real." Goblin is home to me. So I'm a little nervous pushing out of my comfort zone and trying some of the roads I have ridden in the past. I do feel more prepared for it, however.

## Music makes it easier

For starters, I have really dialed in my headphones, earplugs, and music. I know it sounds like a cop out, but not heaving the deafening traffic all the time makes a huge difference in my level of calm and heart rate. Sure people are flying by at over 50 mph usually. Sure I would die instantly if they ever struck me. Still, not hearing them takes care of that. I do look behind me pretty regularly out of habit on unsafe roads. It's annoying but a good habit to get into again. I have a Garmin Varia but find it simply isn't reliable and I have to look back anyway. Same with any mirror. I can also adapt and take the earplugs out when I'm on a hyper sketch section of connecting road.

## Can change the time to Sunday/Saturday morning

There are a couple local bike clubs that ride on Saturday morning before there is much traffic. The route they take is horrible anytime after 10 am when traffic starts, but they finish usually about that time. I always see them concluding in Davidson around 11 am. Now that the weather is better and I have more cold weather gear it might be time to join them. It just makes the logistics easier and they have routes that have very few stops.
