Today's ride was crazy fun. It's the same exact Goblin route that I do every single day, but today something clicked. I realized I actually prefer to ride through the suburbs like a sprinting bike messenger and stopping and jumping over things like Kevin Bacon in Quicksilver, my hands on the drops pumping like Cavendish wearing slightly less lycra (and power), cheap cotton t-shirt flapping in the breeze.

Here I have been feeling almost a level of guilt for not wanting to do long miles out on farm roads like a proper roady waiting to be killed from behind by some asshole on his phone. 

Here's the thing, if I'm gonna die, I want it to be from someone in front of me no matter who's fault it is. I'll take the face plant I did when that party girl pulled out any day over getting mowed down by a semi who fell asleep.

The other day I started doubting this style of riding and my regular Goblin route while waiting at two different stop lights for what felt like 10 minutes each. I started searching for long stretches of road with no stop signs or intersections instead of Goblin. I'm so glad today that I gave up looking for one of these boring farm roads that the spandex set loves so much. I feel liberated somehow.

Instead, today I kept the intensity up, averaging 240 watts (which is a lot for me). I sprinted on everything and caught my breath in between when forced to stop. It's a style of riding that doesn't play well into any official pro training plan, but I don't give a shit. It's fun. It also pairs well with flow MTB HC trails that I also really love and would probably pair well with a good, actual gravel ride if I ever wanted to get into that.

So here's to being a t-shirt wearing, skater-bike-messenger-wannabe, stuck in the suburbs. Fuck the peloton. 

This is why I loved crits so much as a kid, until I realized they are just big boring crash-up-derbies without as much scenery and all the risk and danger that is completely in someone else's control. Being a shameless suburban sprinter means if I go down it is usually going to be because of me and not some idiot tapping the brakes at the wrong time ahead of me.

This also frees me from the insane idea that I have to spend even one second in the fucking gym. Who gives a shit. I'll do yoga, skate, run, and do body-weight stuff. I don't _care_ if my legs become tree-trunks and my FTP blows over 300. It's never been about that and I just forgot, for a second. I'll leave the power meter on because I love self-vs-self competition and that's the best way, but that's it. I'm *never* competing against anyone else. I know from experience that I 

I just wish there were a suburban sprinter ally cat equivalent. Maybe I should invent it.
