Today's ride was crazy fun. It's the same exact route that I do every single day, but today something clicked. I realized I actually prefer to ride through the suburbs like a bike messenger sprinting and stopping and jumping over things like Kevin Bacon in Quicksilver, my hands on the drops pumping like Cavendish wearing slightly less lycra (and power), cheap cotton t-shirt flapping in the breeze.

Here I have been feeling almost a level of guilt for not wanting to do long miles out on farm roads like a proper roady waiting to be killed from behind by some asshole on his phone. 

Here's the thing, if I'm gonna die, I want it to be from someone in front of me no matter who's fault it is. I'll take the face plant I did when that party girl pulled out any day over getting mowed down by a semi who fell asleep.

The other day I started doubting this style of riding and my regular Goblin route while waiting at two different stop lights for what felt like 10 minutes each. I started searching for long stretches of road with no stop signs or intersections instead of Goblin. I'm so glad today that I gave up looking for one of these boring farm roads that the spandex set loves so much. I feel liberated somehow.

Instead, today I kept the intensity up, averaging 240 watts (which is a lot for me). I sprinted on everything and caught my breath in between when forced to stop. It's a style of riding that doesn't play well into any official pro training plan, but I don't give a shit. It's fucking fun. It also pairs well with flow MTB HC trails that I also really love and would probably pair well with a good, actual gravel ride if I ever wanted to get into that.

So here's to being a skater-at-heart, bike messenger with gears wannabe stuck in the suburbs. Fuck the peloton. This is why I loved crits so much as a kid, until I realized they are just big boring crash-up-derbies without as much scenery and all the risk and danger that is completely in someone else's control. Being a shameless suburban sprinter means if I go down it is usually going to be because of me and not some idiot tapping the brakes at the wrong time ahead of me.
