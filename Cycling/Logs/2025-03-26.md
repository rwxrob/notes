Today I'm going to ride the LKN Medio Fondo loop for recon instead of Goblin.

Yesterday was the first day I can remember in the last three years since my return to cycling that I was notably annoyed by the limitations of stopping and riding on greenways. I know. I'm Mr. Goblin Hunter, but who says I have to be? I do find Goblin to be so enjoyable, so much of visual interest, absolutely no worries, and just enough of every type of riding that I like on pavement to keep it really fun. It really is like "Zwift for real." Goblin is home to me. So I'm a little nervous pushing out of my comfort zone and trying some of the dangerous "lonely" farm roads I have ridden in the past. I do feel more prepared for it, however.
## Music makes it easier

For starters, I have really dialed in my headphones, earplugs, and music. I know it sounds like a cop out, but not heaving the deafening traffic all the time makes a huge difference in my level of calm and heart rate. Sure people are flying by at over 50 mph usually. Sure I would die instantly if they ever struck me. Still, not hearing them takes care of that.

I do look behind me pretty regularly out of habit on unsafe roads. It's annoying but a good habit to get into again. I have a Garmin Varia but find it simply isn't reliable and I have to look back anyway. Same with any mirror.

This setup allows me to take the earplugs out when I'm on a hyper sketch section of connecting road so I can hear everything. One nice thing about lonely country roads is that you can hear pretty much anything approaching from very far back.
## Can change the time to Sunday/Saturday morning

There are a couple local bike clubs that ride on Saturday morning before there is much traffic. Now that the weather is better and I have more cold weather gear it might be time to join them. It just makes the logistics easier and they have routes that have very few stops.

The routes they take are horrible anytime after 10 am when traffic starts, but they finish usually about that time. I always see them concluding in Davidson around 11 am.  I could still do a few really slow laps of Goblin after that to get a century training ride in.

Another option is to do my own solo Fondo on century very early Sunday morning when there is absolutely no traffic. But I have been passed by drunk party people as late as 7am before.

## I've been around enough to be scared and be okay with it

I don't like mentioning any of this to anyone to bikes seriously. There is no escaping judgement from a lot of them. They think I'm just old and slow and scared, that I'm "a pussy" for not being able to handle a little traffic. Those people haven't lived through the mangled deaths of their peer cyclists on the road or been hit repeatedly, or lost their teeth to drivers not paying attention. 

One time the girl hit me with a stolen car on "bike to work day" and I had to fight for months to get insurance to cover a new bike to I could go to work. 

I'm not making this shit up. 

Search for every major ultra cyclist record holder in the last two decades and see how _all of them_ died on roads just like these.

One guy was completely stopped at a red light off the side of the road. Obliterated by an idiot teenager. I mean there was nothing left. 

Another was completely crushed under the wheels of a semi who "fell asleep at the wheel" in the middle of no where on an otherwise mostly empty road. 

Another didn't die but was seriously hospitalized by a local _judge_ who hit him and got off for it.

Another was _pushed_ off the road to her death by dudes in a truck thinking it was funny.

These are actual things that have happened since I've been alive. So to all those who judge me for wanting to be safe and slow and boring even with the serious annoyances of the greenways and stop lights: FUCK YOU! It's scary out there. The more you live to ride that bike the more you realize how lucky you are. I still don't have my teeth back after two years and will be in another two years of surgery to get them and my nose fixed.
