I woke up feeling great. Can't wait for my Fenix to arrive so I can start tracking morning resting heart rate more reliably. Not quite into getting a Whoop. I hate stuff on my wrists generally because I'm a techy who types all the time. (Thanks to my friend, who works at Garmin for getting me that deal.)

Just planning to spin out the legs today and recover. Lots of stuff around the house. Just enjoy the goegeous day. I need to set aside time to install my 160mm cranks at some point.
