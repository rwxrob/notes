I woke up feeling great. No sign of soreness anywhere in my body at all. Seriously, I can do jumping jacks and have tons of energy. How the hell did I get that century ride so perfect yesterday? I was wondering if I could do one century a week. Now I have no doubt I can.

Can't wait for my Fenix to arrive so I can start tracking morning resting heart rate more reliably. (Thanks to my friend, who works at Garmin for getting me that deal.) Not quite into getting a Whoop. I hate stuff on my wrists generally because I'm a techie who types all the time. 

Today, just planning to spin out the legs recover and just enjoy this gorgeous day. Maybe I'll test out the Jetton park MTB trail on Roscoe. Wife is gone at work all day. Looks like a day at the bike shed cleaning and organizing. Maybe I'll install my 160mm cranks.

I did it. I bought the HADRONÂ² Ultimate 620 wheel set. (Yes, the work bonus cash came in.) I figure why wait. I'm not getting any younger and yesterday's century proved that a new mid depth aero wheel set can make a big difference in my targeted "competition" distances (Fondo and century). Plus I just really _want_ them. At least I'm not one of those dumping money they don't have on a Tesla or stupid roadster or crappy car with loud pipes. Birkdale has been great to show me all the type of people I _never_ want to be.
