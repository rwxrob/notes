I woke up feeling great. No sign of soreness anywhere in my body at all. Seriously, I can do jumping jacks and have tons of energy. How the hell did I get that century ride so perfect yesterday? I was wondering if I could do one century a week. Now I have no doubt I can.

Can't wait for my Fenix to arrive so I can start tracking morning resting heart rate more reliably. (Thanks to my friend, who works at Garmin for getting me that deal.) Not quite into getting a Whoop. I hate stuff on my wrists generally because I'm a techie who types all the time. 

Today, just planning to spin out the legs recover and just enjoy this gorgeous day. Maybe I'll test out the Jetton park MTB trail on Roscoe. Wife is gone at work all day. Looks like a day at the bike shed cleaning and organizing. Maybe I'll install my 160mm cranks.

I did it. I bought the Swiss Side HADRONÂ² Ultimate 620 wheel set, the fastest GC wheels in the world. Yes, the work bonus cash came in. I figure why wait. I'm not getting any younger and yesterday's century proved that a new mid depth aero wheel set can make a big difference in my targeted "competition" distances (Fondo and century). Plus I just really _want_ them. They look and sound _so damn cool_. Plus they are perfect for the hubs are so freaking loud. I don't need a bell. That used to annoy me when I live streamed. Not any more. F*** live streaming. So much happier focusing on the ride, the music, and the moment. Sure they cost $2000 for full front and back wheel system. But at least I'm not one of those dumping money they don't have on a Tesla or stupid roadster or crappy car with loud pipes. Riding daily through Birkdale has been great to show me all the type of people I _never_ want to be. By the way, the cost of Swiss Side wheels is less than half that for _slower_ wheels from DT Swiss or Specialized Roval. Swiss Side is a freaking amazing company bringing bike costs back to normal levels and doing it with high-end pro quality. I almost consider it a charitable donation to promote the type of cycling and companies I want to see succeed.
