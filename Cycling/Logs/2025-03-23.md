I woke up this beautiful Sunday morning feeling great. No sign of soreness anywhere in my body at all. Seriously, I can do jumping jacks and have tons of energy. How the hell did that century ride work out so perfectly yesterday? And here I was all worried. Yesterday, I was wondering if I could manage one century a week. Now I have no doubt. I suppose that is one main reason I have started writing these logs.

Today I'm just planning to spin out the legs recover and just enjoy this gorgeous day. Maybe I'll test out the Jetton park MTB trail on Roscoe. Wife is gone at work all day. Looks like a day at the bike shed cleaning and organizing. Maybe I'll install my 160mm cranks.

Can't wait for my Fenix to arrive so I can start tracking morning resting heart rate more reliably. (Thanks to my friend, who works at Garmin for getting me that deal.) Not quite into getting a Whoop. I hate stuff on my wrists generally because I'm a techie who types all the time. 

(Yes, the work bonus cash came in and looking at a sizable check from accident settlement soon as well.)

I also bought the Swiss Side HADRONÂ² Ultimate 620 wheel set, the fastest GC wheels in the world.  I figured why wait. At 57 I'm not getting any younger and yesterday's century proved that a new mid-depth aero wheel set can make a 5-10 minute difference in my targeted "competition" average speed and distances (Fondo and century). Yes I'm all about the ride and comfort but I am still obsessed with performance potential. It's in my DNA.

Plus I just really _want_ them. like _really_ bad. It's absolute pure lust. They look and sound _so damn cool_. Plus the loud hubs make all the connecting greenway sections that much easier to manage with pedestrians. I don't need a bell. 

Loud hubs used to annoy me when I live streamed. Not any more. Now the very thought of livestreaming while riding pisses me off just thinking about it. Everything is better without it now, everything. I am so much happier focusing on the ride, the music, and the moment. 

Sure these wheels cost $2000 for full front and back wheel system but at least I'm not one of those idiots at Birkdale dumping money they don't have on a Tesla or stupid roadster or crappy car with loud pipes. It's kind of my goal to piss even more of those types of people off by just existing. I cannot imagine all the cognitive dissonance going through their minds trying to resolve all their debt on stupid cars that they have to set the seat way back on because they can't fit their beer guts behind the steering wheels. Sounds elitist? I suppose. It's also the truth. At least I actually _wave_ to everyone unlike 40% of the Spandex super heroes I pass on the road every day.

By the way, the cost of Swiss Side wheels is less than half that for _slower_ wheels from DT Swiss or Specialized Roval. Swiss Side is a freaking amazing company bringing bike costs back to normal levels and doing it with high-end pro quality. I almost consider it a charitable donation to promote the type of cycling and companies I want to see succeed.

Must be Sunday, because I'm waxing all philosophical:

Today's ride started as a recovery ride and turned into a hill climbing dance party with urban messenger sprint session. I was so completely filled with joy today. I think it is a combination of Spring, perfect music, the weather, unlocking a new level of fitness, and the 4 total scoops of recovery powder, perhaps the B12 in it but maybe just getting the sodium recovery right.

After today's ride and a nice Sunday nap I was compelled to fill the gaps on all my Winter kit that is now on sale. All this positive feeling of cycling is overwhelming. I _must_ have more, like forever. I did spend a lot, but these are the type of kit items that you only buy once every 10 years or so, like Winter tights with wind protection. I have the Winter shoes and tops to go with them, so I'll be good for a very long time. That level of security goes a long way to motivating me to keep riding outside no matter what. Plus I have all my kit stuff now in the bike shed hung from a garment rack. I just love looking at it. No fussing. I grab exactly the perfect kit items for the conditions, do a lap around the storage unit place to check it, then adjust and head out. It's literally the perfect system. I wish I had starting doing this system years ago.

Before Summer hits I should test this Winter kit  out on some really early morning sessions. Normally I wait until 11 when the daytime temps have stabilized. Most serious cyclists here and elsewhere seem to do most of their riding in the very early morning, probably because they have families and jobs and don't let them go out in the afternoon. They usually finish by 11 so I run into them and see they have all their Winter cold weather kit on.

| Route        | Time   | Weather   | Focus          | Distance | Elevation | Time | NPower | TSS |
| ------------ | ------ | --------- | -------------- | -------- | --------- | ---- | ------ | --- |
| Goblin Medio | 4:30pm | Sunny 22C | Nothing really | 61       | 577       | 2:38 | 179    | 162 |

- Added [Lake Norman Goblin 42K](https://www.strava.com/segments/38803916) for recovery and to pair with 2x Goblin Medio to equal a century but ended up not riding it. In fact, I'm beginning to think I never will but nice to have it. It will be doing 1, 2, or 3 loops eventually. I felt like I could go longer yesterday and since a century pretty much chews up the entire day, why not go for three full loops (180k, 112 miles). With the refueling pitstops it will be more like 120 miles.
## Nutrition

- Key Nutrients Electrolyte Recovery Plus, 2x500ml, 2 scoops ea.
- 1/3 cup Karo Light Corn Syrup, split between bottles, 60g carbs, 30 per lap

No problems absorbing the carbs in that dose. In fact, I think that is the most I will take in as liquid. If I ever need more I'll pack some rice balls as well. I've spiked blood sugar in the past and had problems. I came home and wasn't even really that thirsty or hungry, which is always a good sign.
