I woke up feeling great. No sign of soreness anywhere in my body at all. Seriously, I can do jumping jacks and have tons of energy. How the hell did I get that century ride so perfect yesterday? I was wondering if I could do one century a week. Now I have no doubt I can.

Can't wait for my Fenix to arrive so I can start tracking morning resting heart rate more reliably. (Thanks to my friend, who works at Garmin for getting me that deal.) Not quite into getting a Whoop. I hate stuff on my wrists generally because I'm a techie who types all the time. 

Today, just planning to spin out the legs recover and just enjoy this gorgeous day. Maybe I'll test out the Jetton park MTB trail on Roscoe. Wife is gone at work all day. Looks like a day at the bike shed cleaning and organizing. Maybe I'll install my 160mm cranks.

Is it bad that I just _want_ the Swiss Side Hadrons even though I'll get blown around by them. They look so damn cool.
