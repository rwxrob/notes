I woke up feeling great. No sign of soreness anywhere in my body at all. Seriously, I can do jumping jacks and have tons of energy. How the hell did I get that century ride so perfect yesterday? I was wondering if I could do one century a week. Now I have no doubt I can.

Today, just planning to spin out the legs recover and just enjoy this gorgeous day. Maybe I'll test out the Jetton park MTB trail on Roscoe. Wife is gone at work all day. Looks like a day at the bike shed cleaning and organizing. Maybe I'll install my 160mm cranks.

Can't wait for my Fenix to arrive so I can start tracking morning resting heart rate more reliably. (Thanks to my friend, who works at Garmin for getting me that deal.) Not quite into getting a Whoop. I hate stuff on my wrists generally because I'm a techie who types all the time. 

(Yes, the work bonus cash came in and looking at a sizable check from accident settlement soon as well.)

I also bought the Swiss Side HADRONÂ² Ultimate 620 wheel set, the fastest GC wheels in the world.  I figured why wait. At 57 I'm not getting any younger and yesterday's century proved that a new mid-depth aero wheel set can make a 5-10 minute difference in my targeted "competition" average speed and distances (Fondo and century). Yes I'm all about the ride and comfort but I am still obsessed with performance potential. It's in my DNA.

Plus I just really _want_ them. like _really_ bad. It's absolute pure lust. They look and sound _so damn cool_. Plus the loud hubs make all the connecting greenway sections that much easier to manage with pedestrians. I don't need a bell. 

Loud hubs used to annoy me when I live streamed. Not any more. Now the very thought of livestreaming while riding pisses me off just thinking about it. Everything is better without it now, everything. I am so much happier focusing on the ride, the music, and the moment. 

Sure these wheels cost $2000 for full front and back wheel system but at least I'm not one of those idiots at Birkdale dumping money they don't have on a Tesla or stupid roadster or crappy car with loud pipes. It's kind of my goal to piss even more of those types of people off by just existing. I cannot imagine all the cognitive dissonance going through their minds trying to resolve all their debt on stupid cars that they have to set the seat 

By the way, the cost of Swiss Side wheels is less than half that for _slower_ wheels from DT Swiss or Specialized Roval. Swiss Side is a freaking amazing company bringing bike costs back to normal levels and doing it with high-end pro quality. I almost consider it a charitable donation to promote the type of cycling and companies I want to see succeed.
