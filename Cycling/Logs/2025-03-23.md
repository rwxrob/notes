I woke up feeling great. No sign of soreness anywhere in my body at all. Seriously, I can do jumping jacks and have tons of energy. How the hell did I get that century ride so perfect yesterday?

Can't wait for my Fenix to arrive so I can start tracking morning resting heart rate more reliably. (Thanks to my friend, who works at Garmin for getting me that deal.) Not quite into getting a Whoop. I hate stuff on my wrists generally because I'm a techie who types all the time. 

Just planning to spin out the legs today and recover. Lots of stuff around the house. Just enjoy the goegeous day. I need to set aside time to install my 160mm cranks at some point.
