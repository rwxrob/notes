Put together [Monthly food plan](../Monthly%20food%20plan.md) since I had to resubscribe to Huel. Being an endurance athlete make eating a secondary hobby for sure, and it can get expensive. I never understand people who waste money on "performance nutrition" things like gels and chews and drinks that are 10 times the cost of light corn syrup and a caffeine pill. Thankfully there are a lot of very cheap, good carb sources out there. I do think discovering Huel instead of a multi-vitamin was a huge find. The feel like the nutrients aren't being peed out like vitamins. Also, now that I'm up to 4 scoops per 2-3 hour ride of electrolyte powder I feel like I'm really nailing some micronutrient and mineral deficiencies I had in my training before.

Wife and I had a great coffee talk discussion about the _true_ expense of eating well and prioritizing resources (time, money).
