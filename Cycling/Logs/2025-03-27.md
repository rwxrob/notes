After realizing my Goblin route is fine for all my riding as a [shameless suburban sprinter](../Shameless%20suburban%20sprinter.md) I can do it anytime of the day or night or week due to how safe and consistent the traffic is, I realized I can add the Saturday century ride as a weekly thing and also add lunchtime [strength and core training](../Strength%20and%20core%20training.md) a couple days a week, forever.

The Saturday century is just to promote all the other factors that prevent long rides and keep my nutrition strategy dialed in.

The volume might seem high and unrealistic to others but it really isn't compared to what adventure cyclists do on the daily. Again, I'm not doing this to beat anyone else. I'm doing it because I love it.

I also don't have a lot going on in my life at the moment.
