After realizing my Goblin route is fine for all my riding since I can do it anytime of the day or night or week due to how safe and consistent the traffic is I realized I can add the Saturday century ride as a weekly thing and also add lunchtime minimal strength training.

Science studies have shown that low-repetition half-squats are the fastest way to power averaging a 30 watt gain. Anything else is really extra for pros. A shameless suburban sprinter like me doesn't need more, but, I admit, I do need some—especially at my age when the single biggest factors for senior quality of life are 1) V02 max and 2) strength—especially in your "booty" like the physical therapist focused on the elderly taught us in yoga teacher training.

The single best core exercise is the side plank with lifted leg and lowering hip to floor and then raising to arch it laterally while lifting leg. This builds glute and lower back strength particularly good for sprinting. I'll do these on the two medium days and add in pushups as well to keep arms strong to hold aero position
