After realizing my Goblin route is fine for all my riding as a shameless suburban sprinter I can do it anytime of the day or night or week due to how safe and consistent the traffic is I realized I can add the Saturday century ride as a weekly thing and also add lunchtime minimal strength training.

Science studies have shown that low-repetition half-squats are the fastest way to power averaging a 30 watt gain. Anything else is really extra for pros. I don't need more strength, but, I admit, I do need some—especially at my age when the single biggest factors for senior quality of life are 1) V02 max and 2) strength—especially in your "booty" like the physical therapist focused on the elderly taught us in yoga teacher training.

On the two medium days I will do core strength training immediately after getting off the bike. The single best core exercise is the side plank with lifted leg and lowering hip to floor and then raising to arch it laterally while lifting leg. This builds glute and lower back strength particularly good for sprinting. I might do an inversion as well just to promote blood flow.

The Saturday century is just to promote all the other factors that prevent long rides and keep my nutrition strategy dialed in.

The volume might seem high but it really isn't compared to what adventure cyclists do on the daily. Again, I'm not doing this to beat anyone else. I'm doing it because I fucking love it.
