Thinking a lot about sustainable volume for my goals again this morning. I really love watching the sun come up while sipping on this coffee with the quiet all around. Reminds me how much I used to ride in the early morning before it was even light out, often to get to Nike. I had to ride with horrible trafficâ€”I mean really horrible. Somehow I adapted. Yesterday I was reminded of one major reason I was able to do that. I had over the hear amazing beats headphones that made every long ride into an amazing music session as well.

After that ride ...
