After todays 180k I'm convinced I'm in the best *stamina* shape of my life for endurance rides with punchy climbs and rolling hills. You wouldn't know it to look at me. Still carrying around enough fat to qualify as "over weight" according to my BMI but I'm not worried. I'd slowly melting off and my skins seems to slowly be recovering so I don't end up needing a tummy tuck or something. I'm still so damn pissed off that I lost all those years of gains starting with the road trip in July last year, then Covid, then a bunch of shitting coding that no one cares about. No sense stressing about it now. Just keep pedaling, daily.

By the way, my focus on burning fat and dialing in my fat-burning energy pathways with *tons* of base training is definitely working—perhaps too well. I feel like my other energy pathways are not as dialed in—specifically when I need to replenish glycogen in muscles and liver during long rides with lots of intensity. Every time I eat simple carbs it seems like whatever my energy pathway preference kicks in it sucks.

I once ate the 40g of carbs as gummy bears and had to quit the ride at 80. I had zero and bonked hard even though I was fine-ish before I ate them. The only explanation for that is that I sugar crashed and the only explanation for that is that I cannot process that many simple carbs at a time. My pancreas probably freaked the fuck out, pumped all the insulin it had, and left me with nothing within 20 minutes.

This ride totally baffled me.  This is long, sorry. I think the explanation has to do with my energy pathway training. The first loop of Goblin I was very strong running off zone 2 fat, full muscle and liver glycogen, and a recent waffle, eggs and coffee. I felt a little like my digestion wasn't dialed in yet but that was probably the eggs fault. I had about 20g of light-corn syrup carb in both bottles along with 2 scoops electrolyte recover (200mg each of sodium) in 550ml bottles. 

I was tired when I pulled in for the first pit stop refuel (at home) but not too bad. I ate two cups of white rice with soy sauce and an egg. I drank a espresso. I filled up 750ml bottles this time because it was getting hot. I put about 30g carbs of corn syrup and 2 scoops of powder. 

I started the second lap strong. Everything felt great. Ran into Brad in River Run and kept pace with him, which was slightly higher than my target, but seemed fine.

Then about an hour into the second lap I could tell something was wrong with my nutrition. Drinking wasn't helping for some reason. My legs felt horrible and I was feeling like I was running out of gas. I wasn't pushing particularly harder than the previous lap. I blamed it on overreaching all week with not enough recovery and swore I would recover next Friday better before next Saturday's century. I made it home for the second pit stop but just before I got there I was seriously thinking of either only doing two laps or cutting 180 to 161 instead. I was spent. I felt like I just could not rev the motor up no matter how hard I tried.

At the second pit stop I realized I needed something to change so I went with the exact same nutrition plan from the last century that felt great the whole time (except for the need to pee more). I put a full two scoops of Huel into 500ml of water and forced it down. It was like drinking an energy bar. I had done that last week but with about 800ml of water (that made me pee). Instead of coffee this time I took a 100mg caffeine pill like last week. And, because I had felt so bad last lap, I took a single Ibuprofen. I loaded up the 750ml bottles with nothing but 2.5 scoops electrolyte powder each (.5 more than usual, 250mg sodium each).

I took off on the last lap feeling strong and decided to just wait and see how I felt. Buy the end of Davidson Warmup I was feeling fantastic, as good as the first lap. I was really going slow for that first part but by the beginning of the next major segment I was pumping up the climbs just fine. I drank sips ever six minutes even though I was still stuffed from the Huel. By the end of the first half I knew something was radically different. I felt like I had gas in the tank to spare but I didn't burn it yet. By the time I was at Birkdale I realized I could practically sprint home if I wanted, I felt that good. The 80s music (the Cult, etc.) sure helped. In fact, earlier in the second lap a slow song came on and I started replaying extremely accurate memories in my head of all the girls I had danced with in high school and how grateful I was for that time of my life, and them for everything they taught me. I started balling. I was overwhelmed with emotion, and probably endorphins. It could also be that the caffeine and Ibuprofen (an upper) kicked in at the same time. In fact, that's what I'm gonna go with as the reason. I was a euphoric wreck but loving all of it. All the pain in my body was absolutely gone. When I got the the Robbins Pond climb I was out of the saddle. I sprinted Catawba somewhat. I can never resist drafting off the cars. I just enjoyed Cornelius Bandit (still have the CR). But then I was out of the saddle for the entire final climb into Davidson. Honest to God. I felt like I could have done another lap. Is this what ultra-endurance athletes feel?

What the heck happened?

Best I can tell it was a perfect storm of corrections:

- More sodium on a hot day (2.5 scoops instead of 2)
- More total water 2x750 instead of 2x550
- Water absorbed better without the corn syrup changing hydration absorption
- Huel digested easily compared to rice and egg that blocked up digestion
- Carb balance in Huel fueled more consistently (gut already well trained to Huel)
- Ibuprofen to take away the pain and promote circulation (blood thinner abused by endurance athletes all the time)
- More caffeine to keep my HR up rather than dropping like it does sometimes in zone 1-2
- Better music playlist

I'm going to try again next week and keep working on this. Unfortunately, I don't think I can control the foods I eat in the Lake Norman Gran Fondo or NCMTC but that's fine. If I ever did a competitive event that I cared about I would be sure my pit stops had my support people there with my refueling stuff that my gut already knows. I hate how sensitive my gut is. But at least I know about it.

It kind of sucks that my whole life I have had a ton of raw endurance ability and always been plagued by gut problems. You can't win podium spots with a bad carburetor, which is fine because I never really sought them out. My mid-pack finish in Nike Masters was just fine. It was fun. I just complete against myself. 

Today reminded me that my best competitive options are to do events that depend on the fat-burning energy pathway, in other words, the long slower stuff. I really hate that because I _love_ to sprint. I can still do sprint stuff, I just have to depend on my muscle and liver glycogen _only_ which is why 2.5 hours with occasional 2-10 second sprints and minimal long-hard climbs is my favorite, which is _exactly_ what Goblin is. I'd probably be fine in any all-out thing that takes 90 minutes or less because I don't really need to refuel. It's the longer 3/4 gas stuff that requires refueling that I cannot do as well as others who can slam a gel or have sugary drinks.

Whenever I try to add simple carbs to fuel higher-power output longer rides I fail miserably. I think I am insulin resistant, perhaps even pre-diabetic, by way of genetics (my family all has type 2 and gets fat really easily). I just cannot eat simple carbs the way other normal people do. My AI says the fix for insulin resistance is "lower carbs, exercise, sleep, muscle gain" which is good because as I've added muscle things are getting better—plus I'll be in the gym on Monday doing my half-squats and core work. My AI nailed the symptoms I've had in the past: "Fatigue, brain fog, weight gain, cravings."

Whew, that's a lot, but probably good to keep this here so I have it for later to refer to.
