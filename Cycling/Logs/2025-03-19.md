So today I got brutally beat up on my normal Goblin ride and turned back at 80k (was planning a century today). I'm not entirely sure what happened but here are the factors:

- 30 degree weather
- 1pm start time instead of 3:30-ish
- Hard ride yesterday with speed/strength focus
- Tried to fuel with Haribo Gummies during ride
- Half water and half electrolyte replacement
- 170 watts for first 50k

I got home and absolutely collapsed. I had been drinking about once every 30 minutes but when I got home I was really dizzy. I ate and drank and fell asleep for like six hours. I did wake refreshed and started to do some digging.

My best guess is that I was way low on electrolytes. I've done similar rides to this one indoors and never had that problem, even after a hard ride the previous day. The main difference is that I'm constantly drinking when riding indoors and that I'm only drinking electrolyte water. On this ride not only did I not drink the same amount, but half of the time it was just water. I've since read that only drinking water can actually dehydrate you faster when really sweating. 

If my research is right, I need 500mg of sodium per hour for a ride like today. I've only been doing 150mg tops for a while. So next ride I will definitely take that up. That's three scoops of powder instead of one per bottle.

The gummy bears are really not fun to manage so I'm going to try something else like last year which also worked well, light Karo syrup added to the drinks with carbs matching the effort. I'm also toying with the idea of making my own gel again so that I can refill water and still use the flask for carbs with the new water + electrolyte powder. I'll also experiment with gummies more once I get the fluids right.

Another alternative to the whole nutrition and water management is to just not go on rides with conditions that require me to carry refueling stuff that is beyond what I can carry in two 750ml bottles of water. From 15-24C I need 750-1000ml per hour. So if I pre-fuel with water just as I take off with about 300ml I should be good for a 2.5 hour ride in mild weather 15-24C. Today was well above that, so I was low on water and electrolytes even though I probably had plenty of glucose. For double goblins I would need to carry all the stuff to refill:

- 2-3 scoops electolyte mix per bottle = 6 scoops
- 150ml of karo carbs in flask split between bottles
- 100mg caffeine pill every hour-ish

The training volume that I've been targeting is primarily to restore my fitness and weight to the levels they were before my trip in 2024. Once I hit that, I'll just be in maintenance mode. What will that look like?

For starters, I'll only be doing a single afternoon ride or workout per day, usually I loop of Goblin with intensities and focus varying from day to day. The Goblin 60k route is absolutely ideal for that sort of variation. I can do three hours of slow recovery and a little zone 2. I can do 2.5 hours of zone 2, or I can do 2 hours of all-out intensity. Pretty much every day I'll finish in 2.5-3 hours. Then on the weekend, I'll do a long ride, but what does a "long ride" actually mean? 

Most of the time "long" will just be Goblin Fondo (2 laps) either at race tempo or zone 2. In fact, I don't know that I ever need to do more than that. 

The fastest event I plan to ride regularly is Lake Norman Gran Fondo, which is 78 miles, about the same as my Goblin Fondo but with far fewer hills than Goblin and with a full peloton to draft. I should never finish that in anything over five hours.

The NC Mountains to Coast is a leisurely 62 miles (100k) per day. At zone 2 pace I should finish every day in about four-five hours not counting stops. I don't know that this means I need to specifically train to ride 100k per day. That is a good pace to get used to for crossing the country or something, but I'm currently not planning anything like that. Instead, this will be absolutely leisurely and the Gran Fondo will be the most competitive I get. I'd rather be able to pull a really fast 120k on a single day than several fast 100k days if it means only 2-3 hours per day instead of 4-5.
