Woke to a nightmare of finding my bike locked to a tree with literally every removable component removed. Seems my psyche is shifting gears (pun intended). I suppose that's what happens when you remove everything in my life from focus that isn't one of the following:

1. Family
2. Job
3. Cycling

It's been a while since my priorities have been that concise. I'm usually all over place juggling all kinds of things.
