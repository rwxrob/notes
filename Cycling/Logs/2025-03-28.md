Woke to a nightmare of finding my bike locked to a tree with literally every removable component removed. Seems my psyche is shifting gears (pun intended). I suppose that's what happens when you remove everything in my life from focus that isn't one of the following:

1. Family
2. Job
3. Cycling

It's been a while since my priorities have been that concise. I'm usually all over place juggling all kinds of things.

The routine of it is producing benefit in time savings, less stress, more reliable gains. Things like my routine of driving to the bike shed, parking in just the right spot so I can use the bumper as a shelf for my water bottles while I open it, and the individual steps to change into my kit are very freeing mentally. I can almost do all of it without thinking, a sort of daily ride autopilot. This is one of the appeals of my same Goblin loop every time. All I have to think about is staying safe and varying my intensity based on the goal of the day. It's absolutely ideal for fitness gains and I can totally tell. It reminds me of the nearly military style of regimented routine they follow in Girona with the pros. And why wouldn't they, controlled routine produces results and at the moment I'm most focused on personal results while still enjoying myself.

Eventually I hope to expand the list:

1. Family
2. Job
3. Cycling
4. Music and song writing
5. Creative writing
6. Art appreciation
7. Bike infrastructure development

I have to be careful, however, because I don't have that much free time when I truly meet the needs of the top three—especially with the pro-level of cycling volume I intend to maintain all year (about 26 hours a week).

Some might notice there is nothing tech related other than my job. I might do a bit of live streaming when I clean up my dot files for personal use as a part of my job but it won't be interactive. I am definitely not planning on building or engaging a live streaming community ever again. Do I miss my friends? Yes, very much. Despite the great relationships I made, live streaming was largely a net negative in my life. People telling me "it's your calling" and then telling me they gave up their teaching job—after I donated 10s of thousands of dollars in server gear—so that they can work for Elon Musk are not people I wish to take moral advice from any longer. I owe nothing to anyone but my family and myself. I realize that more now than ever before. I sunk at least $10000 in gear, software, trips, and other stuff that was all completely driven by streaming. The income from it did slightly offset the cost. But let's face it, Twitch income never came close to covering the amount of money and _time_ I was spending, time better spent focusing on being the best at my job that I can be.
