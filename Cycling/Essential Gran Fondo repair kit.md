After reading a lot about it I decided carrying an ultra minimal repair kit on my Gran Fondo events and daily training rides. Even though these events are well supported it is worth the savings it will provide in time. Plus getting into the habit of carrying the essentials will make daily rides easier. I once carried a kit including a full foldable tire replacement when I commuted daily. But I don't think I need that much. I just need enough to limp home and if all else fails I'll call an Uber or get the "ride anywhere" coverage Garmin is now offering. I'm never riding anywhere on my road bike that is not near help if needed.

- [2 Pedro tire levels](https://a.co/d/0frUbNg)
- [Continental TPU Tube ](https://a.co/d/eVs59AI) (same shipped with Swiss Side wheel set)
- [Topeak Mini 9 multi tool (no need for chain stuff)](https://a.co/d/30ckrGy)
- [Flextail ultra mini usb bike pump](https://www.flextail.com/products/tiny-bike-pump)
- [Ornot Ecopack black](https://www.ornotbike.com/products/seat-bag-ecopak-black)

I can swap out the Mini 9 for my much heavier Crankbros for any rides where chain might be at risk and add in a master link and a section of chain, but honestly, I don't plan on riding in many of those events if at all. I mean, if I have road shoes on I'm not on anything but ultra light gravel. I'll add some plugs when riding with tubeless gravel tires if I go that route but will keep the tube no matter what in case it fails.
