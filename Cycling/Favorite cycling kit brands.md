Most people would have a hard time knowing what brand I'm wearing. All my favorite brands have that same minimal logos vibe and are dedicated to ride quality and style above branding.

1. MAAP - expensive Italian stuff but oh so amazingly well made and fashionable, plus dual
2. Club Ride - best in class performance casual gear, definitely gravel vibe
3. NeoPro - serious, professional roadie kit that's fun and inexpensive
4. OrNot - similar to Club Ride but more urban vibe

I'm not listing Gorewear or Patagonia, yet. My Patagonia Nano-Air vest is my single favorite piece of clothing. It is so freaking comfortable and useful in so many different situations even if it is my bulky than most cycling vests. I haven't had enough time in my Gorewear windbreakers to really recommend them. Most of the time I think a windbreaker is just to cover your kit selection mistakes on a ride. That one day when temps dropped from 25 to 13 would have been a good day to pull it out if I had been carrying it.

> I cringe every time I see someone in serious logo team kit. The funny thing is when I was Nike Team Endorphin and Logi Velo I wore nothing but branded kit for years and thought it was amazing. Makes me want to vomit a little thinking about it now. I mean no offense to others just making an observation about how my own taste has changed. I'm sure people look at my camo bibs and cotton Hanes tee shirt or my western ClubRide gravel shirt and my tight bibs that make me look like a perv riding his bike around in his underwear and cringe just has much as I do and that's fine. To each his own. Performance speaks for itself. It doesn't need a logo.
