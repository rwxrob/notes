After hauling way to much around with me in 2023-24 I've decided the maximum weight I will every carry is 2.1 kilos in a TailFin AeroPack (inspired by [Taylor Dawson](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/HSxsF0F9tP4)). I noticed that Lachlan had a similar strategy on Tour Divide, the least amount of packing fuss possible. With with bigger pack I can easily pack a comfy tent even if I wanted.
