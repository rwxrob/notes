Over the years what I eat has really changed based on level of activity, training, budget, and available options. Here's there I keep track of what I eat over the course of a month and how much it costs. I have to do these every once in a while to remind myself how much cheaper and better for my health it is to _not_ eat out, ever. I feel like so many endurance athletes, pros and casuals, just don't get this right. I know I mess it up a lot. Here are the main points:

- Absolutely, positively no alcoholâ€”especially not that Sam Adams _Just the Hop_ exists
- No fried food whatsoever
- Use Huel instead of daily multi-vitamins and fish oil
- Focus on good cheap carbs to fill up: rice, waffles, potatoes

Here's my normal daily food intake:

- Coffee + waffle + two hardboiled eggs mashed up with 1 tbsp mayo, paprika, salt (wake)
- waffle + 1 scoop Huel Black Chocolate(+3 hours)
- 1 cup white rice + 1 cup lentils (3 hours before ride)
- coffee + waffle (30 minutes before ride)
- 4x Electrolyte powder scoop + light corn syrup (on ride)
- 2 Sam Adams _Just the Hop_ beers (1 immediately after ride, 1 later with popcorn)
- big carb-heavy dinner with family, often pasta with roasted veggies (dinner )
- 1 bowl popcorn popped in olive oil + salt (nothing else)
- 1/7 Camembert  cheese
- 1 dark chocolate bar
- 1 scoop Huel (just before bed)

When I do a century on a weekend I eat the following during each of the two pit stops:

- 1 cup white rice
- 1 scoop Huel Black Chocolate (minimal water so no need to pee on ride)
- 100 mg Caffeine pill

I also end up eating a lot more random snacks on evening of century.

So my monthly shopping list without dinners looks something like this:

| Staple      | Cost |
| ----------- | ---- |
| Waffle Mix  | $10  |
| Rice        | $20  |
| Lentils     | $40  |
| Eggs        | $40  |
| Huel        | $90  |
| Beer        | $85  |
| Popcorn     | $20  |
| Camembert   | $32  |
| Chocolate   | $20  |
| Olive Oil   | $20  |
| Caffeine    | $10  |
| Elecrolytes | $51  |
| Corn Syrup  | $40  |
| TOTAL       | $478 |

Yeah, that's a lot considering it doesn't count dinner (which my wife always makes and generally pays for). Still, that is not a fraction of the cost people pay just to have a regular coffee or beer or eat out with friends. The best part about having this staples cover all my bases is that I really don't have to think about it and can add in variety randomly without freaking out that I'll be missing out on something.
