Even though I really will never _need_ these, I can sure _want_ them. They just look so damn cool, to be honest. Can you imagine me with these and my baggy, very non-aero gravel/daily training kit? Truth be told my stock 32c endurance Bontrager wheels and tires maxed at 70 psi on my Trek are exactly perfect for 95% of the riding I do on pristine and sometimes a little rough pavement.

- ~~DT Swiss ARC 1100 DICUT db 62~~
- ~~Continental Grand Prix 5000 S TR 28c both~~
- 11-30 cassette

I looked seriously at the Specialized Rovals but the DT Swiss are just plain better for performance and—let's face it—prettier.
