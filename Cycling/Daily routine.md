I've modified my daily routine to matching ride times with sunrise during the warm months


**5:30 a.m. — Wake**

- Natural light or alarm (sunrise simulator helps)
- Quick mobility/stretch if desired
-
2. **Hydrate**
    
    - Drink 12–16 oz water to rehydrate from sleep
        
    
3. **Coffee**
    
    - Black (or however you take it), ~80–100mg caffeine
        
    - Enhances fat oxidation and alertness
        
    
4. **Fuel**
    
    - One plain waffle (~150–200 kcal, ~30g carbs)
        
    - Keeps liver glycogen up without spiking insulin or slowing digestion
        
    
5. **Bathroom**
    
    - Wait for natural voiding (aided by water + coffee)
        
    - Key for comfort and consistent weigh-ins
        
    
6. **Weigh Yourself**
    
    - Naked, post-void, pre-clothes
        
    - Log in morning notes for long-term trend tracking
        
    
7. **Morning Notes / Journal**
    
    - Quick bullet: weight, mood, sleep, soreness
        
    - Optional: intention for today’s ride, motivation check-in
        
    
8. **Drive to Bike Shed**
    
    - Pack bottle/fuel if needed
        
    - Mentally shift into ride mode
        
    
9. **6:30 a.m. — Roll Out**
    
    - Right as the sun crests
        
    - Quiet roads, optimal temps, perfect light
