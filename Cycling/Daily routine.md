Training requires a routine, period. No one ever got good without one. This is why so many people fail. Most of them just let their lives happen to them without taking control.
## General hours

Bike training days are Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and are the busiest since I try to get 2-3 hours in on those days. Gym days only take about an hour so bike day time is made up by shorter gym t. Saturday is my "get shit done" day. Sunday is my "all day on the bike" day.

- 7-7:30 Breakfast and morning routine
- 7:30-9:30 Focused work time (most productive of day)
- 9:30 Drive to bike shed or gym
- 10:00 Start training
- noon-ish to 7 Work

Sunday: century

- 140+km Long, slow training on bike
