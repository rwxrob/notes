Training like a pro while still having a full-time job requires a routine. No one ever got good without one. This is why so many people fail. Most of them just let their lives happen to them without taking control and pushing to get things done more efficiently.
## Best daily training route

My Daily 60k is the safest route with the best roads in terms of quality and traffic and scenery that I can come up with. I hate that the connectors have as much traffic on them as they do, but that's life. They are all very ridable between 10am and 1pm on any weekday provided I have my radar, good rear flashing light, and relatively visible clothing.

This route takes me 2.5 hours at my slowest pace in Z1-Z2 (which will only increase).
## General hours

Bike training days are Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and are the busiest since I try to get 2-3 hours in on those days. Gym days only take about an hour so the longer time taken from bike training days is made up by shorter gym training session. Plus I can actually attend a meeting on Wednesday while on the bike because it is a "listen in" meeting mostly. Saturday is my "get shit done" day. Sunday is my "all day on the bike" day.
