The first thing you should look at on Strava is time, distance, elevation, and average speedâ€”not watts. Some on Strava put out major watts on their rides but have relatively low average speed for the same distance and elevation as others. There are lots of explanations for this but one very possible explanation is that they are simply less efficient than the others.

Almost no one on the Internet talks about efficiency. I've heard a few wise YouTubers talk about how very little FTP actually matters. It's just a starting point. Ultimately what matters is how fast to get to the finish line (and that you do it ahead of others if competitive). Sure that has to do with power but not nearly as much as riders think when comparing themselves to others. FTP is a thing you can immediately spot off that everyone understands, unfortunately. It's only the *good* riders who now how completely stupid FTP numbers actually are.

So what is valuable for comparing?

Watts per kilo is Zwift's measure but it leaves out so much. Technique and skills are completely ignored. These include climbing without losing energy and aerodynamics both in the ability to hold an aero position and the research and financial sacrifices to pick the right bike and kit for the ride. These are massive contributors to efficiency.

This just proves why Pogacar prefers HR data over everything else. Watts are often unreliable and highly relative to the person, bike, and power meter. In fact, it makes it a bit worrisome that Zwift competitions rely so heavily on them. The problem is that people don't share their HR data on Strava, usually, and probably for good reason. Everyone's heart rate is very personal and completely relative. It's not like Strava has a way to post data relative to Lactate Threshold Heart Rate. Okay, they kinda do, but clearly Strava is watts-centric.
