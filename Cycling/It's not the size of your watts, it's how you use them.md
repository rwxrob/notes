I've noticed some people on Strava put out major average watts on their rides but have relatively low average speed for the same distance and elevation as others. There are lots of explanations for this but the most important distinction is that people posting higher watts than others for the same distances and elevations under the same weather conditions are simply not as efficient and efficiency has no Strava metric. Would that it did.

I've heard a few wise YouTubers talk about how very little FTP actually matters. It's just a starting point. Ultimately what matters is how fast to get to th

This just proves why Pogacar prefers HR data over everything else. Watts are often unreliable and highly relative to the person, bike, and power meter. In fact, it makes it a bit worrisome that Zwift competitions rely so heavily on them. The problem is that people don't share their HR data on Strava, usually, and probably for good reason. Everyone's heart rate is very personal and completely relative. It's not like Strava has a way to post data relative to Lactate Threshold Heart Rate. Okay, they kinda do, but clearly Strava is watts-centric.
