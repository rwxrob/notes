- Carry own nutrition since predicatable
- Plan own nutrition for six hours every time, even if shorter just to get into the habit
- Only use 550 bottles to simulate race on-bike nutrition skills
- First two bottles carb + electrolyte to start (first two hours)
- Remaining hours one bottle water per hour minimum refilling with only water
- Use water bottles optionally for cooling as well (after first two hours)
- Gels with carb and electrolyte for hours 3-6
- Adapt homemade gel to conditions (pace, gut training, sodium)
- The 250g of added weight for my own flask are easily made up in time savings refueling in seconds instead of minutes. 
- This assumes a 300 FTP so no more than 100g carbs per hour is actually burned. I'll likely never need to go over and if so will add solid food.
- Taking one no-doze (200mg caffeine) at hour 2.5 and optionally another at hour 3.5 (never more since 400mg is max).

## Training ride plan to train gut

- Pre-fuel on waffles and/or rice (120g) 2-3 hours before
- Work from 40g to 100g of carbs in each 550ml bottle (2:1 maltodextrin to fructose + sodium, 2 hours worth)
- Additional 10g per week
- Convert to gel and water at 2 hour mark
- Keep training sessions 3+ hours with identical carb strategy in 2025 to train gut but vary intensity
- Move away from fat-burning as primary fuel source gradually
- Reduce body fat with daily diet without changing training carb strategy, eat less _after_ ride
