- Carry own nutrition since predictable, supplement with feed zones if and when needed (just bananas)
- Plan own nutrition for six hours every time, even if shorter just to get into the habit
- Only use 550 bottles to simulate race on-bike nutrition skills
- First two bottles hourly carb requirement + electrolyte to start (first two hours)
- Remaining hours 550 water per hour minimum
- Refill with only water too keep feed zones fast and allow use of water for cooling, cleaning injuries, dogs, etc.
- Gels with hourly carb and electrolyte for hours 3-6 (250ml + 150ml)
- Adapt homemade gel to conditions (pace, gut training, sodium)
- No-doze (200mg caffeine) at hour 3 and optionally another at hour 4 (never more since 400mg is max).
## Training ride plan to train gut

- Pre-fuel on waffles and/or rice (120g) 2-3 hours before
- Work from 40g to 100g of carbs in each 550ml bottle (2:1 maltodextrin to fructose + sodium, 2 hours worth)
- Additional 10g per week
- Convert to gel and water at 2 hour mark
- Find reliable water source to simulate feed zone at hour 2
- Keep training sessions 3+ hours with identical carb strategy to train gut but vary intensity
- Move away from fat-burning as primary fuel source gradually
- Reduce body fat with daily diet without changing training carb strategy, eat less _after_ ride
