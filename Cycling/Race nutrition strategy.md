- Carry own nutrition since predictable, supplement with feed zones if and when needed (just bananas)
- Plan own nutrition for six hours every time, even if shorter just to get into the habit and cover unexpected (worth 300grams or so)
- Only use 550 bottles to simulate race on-bike nutrition skills
- Never anything but water in bottles to keep feed zones fast and allow water for cooling, cleaning injuries, docs, etc.
- Adapt homemade gel to conditions (pace, gut training, sodium) into 250ml flasks with hourly carb + electrolyte
- No-doze (200mg caffeine) at hour 3 and optionally another at hour 4 (never more since 400mg is max).
## Training ride plan to train gut

- Pre-fuel on waffles and/or rice (120g) 2-3 hours before
- Work from 50g to 100g per hour to [match power output](Carbs%20burned%20per%20watt%20per%20hour.md)
- Additional 10g per week
- Convert to gel and water at 2 hour mark
- Find reliable water source to simulate feed zone at hour 2
- Keep training sessions 3+ hours with identical carb strategy to train gut but vary intensity
- Move away from fat-burning as primary fuel source gradually
- Reduce body fat with daily diet without changing training carb strategy, eat less _after_ ride
- Push pace higher on training rides and find recoverability limit
