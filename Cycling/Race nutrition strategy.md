- Pre-fuel on waffles or other carb (120g) 2-3 hours before event
- Carry own homemade gel since predictable, supplement with feed zones if and when needed (just bananas)
- Plan own nutrition for max of six hours if more is needed supplement with external sources on ride
- Never anything but water in bottles to keep feed zones fast and allow water for cooling, cleaning injuries, docs, etc.
- Decide on whether 550 or 750 are needed based on feed zones (even 950 depending on event)
- Max water capacity is 750x3 with one in jersey
- Adapt homemade gel to conditions (pace, gut training, sodium) in 250ml flasks with hourly carb + electrolyte
- Plan from 50g to 120g per hour to [match power output](Carbs%20burned%20per%20watt%20per%20hour.md)
- No-doze (200mg caffeine) at hour 3 and optionally another at hour 4 (never more since 400mg is max).
