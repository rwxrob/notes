I watched a video with a bunch of bike messengers more into the vibe and their look that anything. I had to chuckle. We all get that way.

One guy was showing off the weight of his minimal titanium bike that he had to drill holes into for a water bottle cage and felt the need to justify. It had gorgeous deep-rim aero wheels. Then he raced with a five pound Kryptonite bike lock for now reason in an Ally Cat. The lock probably weighed slightly less than his bike.

I know that bike messengers are not into logic and science—like at all. They are _so_ into the vibe. They wouldn't ride a fixie with no brakes and no helmet in the middle of New York if logic and good sense were involved in their decision making process. It's all about that look and "street cred" and—oh my god—don't you _dare_ call them out on it.

I get that people are into the art of it, but sometimes form supplants function and you just look stupid. The same could be said of seriously overweight people stuffing themselves into skintight spandex. Why? It isn't the aero drag that is slowing them down.

I'm just making an observation. Sometimes I feel like wearing the right thing to join the club (or cult) matters more than the reason the cult was formed in the first place. In cycling this is _everywhere_.

Now I have a confession to make. I proudly wear a wind-flapping western style gravel shirt that costs as much as three standard bike jerseys while riding my aluminum bike with top-of-the-line carbon deep rim aero wheels Why? Because it just looks so cool. I'm no better than any of the rest.
