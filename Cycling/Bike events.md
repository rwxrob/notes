Keeping track of planned events and those I've done. Some thoughts about these lists:

- Prefer competitive Gran Fondos with semi-serious riders for most events
- Happy to mix in some fun events for bike-lovers when no conflicts
- Love the[ Gran Fondo national series](https://www.granfondonationalseries.com/gfns-events-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com) most
- Love https://ncsports.org/ and their supported cycling events
- 24 Hours of Booty is super boring and mostly just a rich-kid party (still doing it once)
