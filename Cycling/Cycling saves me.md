Some people might see my Strava and wonder why so much, so often. The answer is rather simple but somehow not entirely obvious. Cycling saves me.

I love my career as a code monkey but the side-effects that appear to be wonderful to anyone looking in from the outside are quite literally deadly. I've worked full-time from home for over 30 years and one truth has emerged: atrophy is real. Almost one year to the day when I stopped cycling for lots of reasons outside of my control and for some that weren't I am happy to report I'm back to were I was fitness-wise (even though I still haven't replaced the teeth knocked out from the accident the year before that yet).

I have witnessed coworkers in variations of my profession literally die from this job. One had a stroke from sitting too much and getting a blood clot in his leg. Another died from a heart attack at 40. Countless others fight with perpetual pain and suffering from morbid obesity (a medical term), type 2 diabetes, and depressed mental states. The danger is subtle. People working in some other professions know their lives are at risk on the daily. People in tech don't even think about it until it is literally too late.

I get maybe 200 steps around the house per day (not counting dog walks and the occasional errand to the store). I bet my daily caloric requirements would barely top 1500 per day and being healthy is obviously much more than consuming even the right calories per day. With that level of activity my body would atrophy to bed-ridden in months without something to counter it. I know because it's nearly happened to me twice.

Because of cycling pretty much every day since mid January I'm happy to report I've made all the fitness gains back and passed them with an FTP hovering around 270 and no difficulty doing a century ride every weekend. My weight is still as high as January but a quick mirror check confirms it is almost all muscle. I have some lingering, annoying jelly rolls to deal with but I fit into my lycra again. ðŸ¤£
