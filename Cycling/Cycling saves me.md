Some people might see my Strava and wonder why so much, so often. The answer is rather simple but somehow not entirely obvious. Cycling saves me. I love my career as a  but the side-effects that appear to be wonderful to anyone looking in from the outside are quite literally deadly.

I've worked full-time from home for over 30 years. I get maybe 200 steps around the house per day (not counting dog walks and the occasional errant to the store). I bet my daily caloric requirements would barely top 1500 per day and being healthy is obviously much more than consuming even the right calories per day. With that level of activity my body would atrophy to bed-ridden in months without something to counter it. I know because it's nearly happened to me twice.
