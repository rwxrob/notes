Some people might see my Strava and wonder why so much, so often. The answer is rather simple but somehow not entirely obvious. Cycling saves me. (No April Fool's joke here.)  
  
I love my career as a code monkey but the benefits of working from home that appear to be wonderful to anyone looking in from the outside are quite literally deadly. For over 30 years I've not left my couch to go to work every day. My wife constantly teases me about how easy I have it. She's right. But one dark truth has emerged: atrophy is real.  
  
Almost exactly one year ago when I stopped cycling for lots of reasons outside of my control and for some that weren't I am happy to report I've finally surpassed were I was fitness-wise even though I still haven't fixed my nose and replaced the teeth knocked out from getting hit and face-planting the year before that. Now comes the tough part. Maintaining these gains even with travel and several surgeries that are going to force me not to train. I'm nervous, which is why I've been training so hard while I can.  
  
I have witnessed coworkers in variations of my profession literally die from this job. One had a stroke from sitting too much and getting a blood clot in his leg. Another died from a heart attack at 40. Countless others fight with perpetual pain and suffering from morbid obesity (a medical term), type 2 diabetes, and depressed mental states. The danger is subtle. People working in certain other professions know their lives are at risk. People in tech don't even think about it until it's too late.  
  
I get maybe 200 steps around the house per day (not counting dog walks and the occasional errand to the store). I bet my daily caloric requirements would barely top 1500 per day and being healthy is obviously much more than consuming even the right calories per day. With that level of activity my body would atrophy to bed-ridden in months without something to counter it. I know because it's nearly happened to me twice.
