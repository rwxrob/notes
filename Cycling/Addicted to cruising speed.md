I'm reminded today that I'm primarily a roadie—specifically an all-roadie because I'm addicted to cruising speed, averaging between 25 and 30 kph through safe, scenic landscapes of all kinds. This speed is perfect to get that feeling of floating over the landscape. It's hypnotizing, meditative. Other all-roadies agree.

## Peloton penalty

As much as I love a good pace-line, there's a serious penalty to be paid when riding in such groups. On the one hand you have the fun group dynamic but on the other that same group dynamic makes it hard to enjoy the cruising speed and scenery itself. It's also not really possible to talk to anyone and ride in a peloton safely.
## Motorcyclist without the motor

I think I get the appeal of ebiking more. It gives cruising speed junkies what they want without the work. The sensation is much like being on a scooter or motorcycling, both things I also love because they work at cruising speed. The feeling of wind pushing back against you is key. There's something wonderful and horrible about it.
## Maybe its the good drugs

Having a motor do all the work robs cruising speed addicts from all the good drugs that might contribute to that addiction. Keeping a cruising speed pace on an unencumbered, aero road bike usually means I'm also swimming in endorphins, dopamine, and serotonin. 

## Just not adrenaline, usually

When on an MTB flow trail I've got a ton of adrenaline as well. Tons of people are addicted to that. I have been as well. Not so much these days, however. For me the adrenaline might be occasionally fun—like drinking alcohol— but because it pumps me full of cortisol as well it is not under the "good drug" category. It turns down recovery, kills testosterone production, and turns up visceral fat storage. It is do damaging that docs to the pros regularly look for cortisol markers to decide if pro is overtraining or even detraining. Less is more, when it comes to adrenaline.
