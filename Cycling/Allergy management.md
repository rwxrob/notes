I suffer from chronic inflammation. I don't understand all the reasons but know they are very complex and include mental stress as well as food and environmental allergens. For some reason, doing 90 minutes of endurance work silences them completely. It's very odd.

When I do get a flare up my whole body itches—including my beard, scalp, and arms—and my stomach gets so bloated it's distended. Sometimes I get small, very itchy sores. I'm told all of that is a histamine reaction. Benedryl shuts it all down but also shuts down my brain and body making it impossible to do anything but sleep. Other daily allergy meds are hit or miss. I also get *really* hungry and unable to sleep. The worst symptom is what it does to my mood. I get really, really angry and frustrated, which just makes it worse.

Here are the foods that I know will almost always trigger an acute chromic inflammation attack:

- More than two cups of milk even without lactose
- Salted Nut Rolls
- Peanuts (which also keep me up at night)
- Tootsie rolls (ate a few from gym)
- Most any beans
- Pasta, even gluten free
- Red meat unless ground up
- Cashews

Foods that are my staples:

- Plain waffles but specifically *only* [Millville Buttermilk brand from Aldis](https://a.co/d/6F6P1Bn)
- Two hard boiled eggs with paprika and salt and a little mayo (three is too much)
- Huel Black Chocolate, which took me a while to adapt to but am now really okay with
- Popcorn with olive oil
- Any white rice (but not brown for some reason)
- Marinara sauce
- Lentils of any kind
- Camebert cheese
- Goat cheese
- Parmasan cheese
- Ice cream
- Chocolate in small amounts
- Pretty much any raw fruit or vegetable

This makes being an endurance athlete very difficult since gut training is such a huge part of it.
