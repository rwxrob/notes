Studio 54 meets practical farm-road cruising speeds. I've been stung at least two times on the open farm roads here. Both times, coincidentally when I was wearing highly colorful jerseys for visibility. This is the only pro helmet on the market with a net to block insects from getting trapped in the helmet vents. Plus it just looks amazing.
