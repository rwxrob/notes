My Specialized Torch 2 shoes are my favorite shoes to ride in, by far. The power distribution is so nice and although they are super stiff they are remarkably comfortable to walk into a bookstore for coffee, or a restaurant to get a burrito. They have a huge pad for the heel so not afraid of grinding it away. The triangular cleat provides lots of stability, unlike the 80s Time pedals I used to have.

My concern about being able to bike-n-hike is completely irrelevant in an "all road" scenario. If I ever had to walk more than a block I'd call an uber (or Doris) or make sure to bring walking sandals (Zeroes) so I could just walk. The worst roads I will ever be on would be muddy or minimal gravel so I never had to do any significant walking in my cycling shoes. Best shoes for the job.
