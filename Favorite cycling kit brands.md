All my favorite brands have that same not overly logo-ed vibe and are dedicated to the ride and quality of their gear above everything else.

1. MAAP - expensive Italian stuff but oh so amazingly well made and fashionable
2. Club Ride - best in class performance casual gear, definitely gravel vibe
3. NeoPro - serious, professional roadie kit that's fun and inexpensive
4. OrNot - similar to Club Ride but more urban vibe

I'm not listing Gorewear or Patagonia, yet. My Patagonia Nano-Air vest is my single favorite piece of clothing. It is so freaking comfortable and useful in so many different situations even if it is my bulky than most cycling vests. I haven't had enough time in my Gorewear windbreakers to really recommend them. Most of the time I think a windbreaker is just to cover your kit selection mistakes on a ride. That one day when temps dropped from 25 to 13 would have been a good day to pull it out if I had been carrying it.
