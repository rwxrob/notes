When I prepare for this upcoming season of cycling and outdoor livestreaming I can't help but remember how much fun it is to challenge myself for a single day. How much riding can I actually survive in a single day? This seems to be the same motivation for Dustin Klein and his "Adventure Squad." On occasion he'll do a single overnighter, but usually he'll drive to the starting place for one of these rides, sleep in his van, get a good early start, and then crash in the van at night. This is the perfect recipe for an amazing weekend adventure.

One thing Dustin has reminded me of is how beat you can get after just a single epic day. All that feeling of accomplishment and wonderful pain that comes with it is really the goal, for me. After riding a day like that, he'll not even look at his bike the next day (unlike a bikepacker). His clothes completely soak through but it doesn't matter because he doesn't have to put them on the next day. 

I remember wanting to get to Jetton Park and crack a beverage at sunset as my goal every day. It made for great videos and some very fun sprints racing against the sun, literally. I look forward to doing a lot more of that in 2025. Jetton Park is a great place to start and finish because it is so beautiful and has such good mobile phone signal. Plus it is a good meeting point if and when I can get anyone else to do a ride with me. This year I do want to invite as many others to do Goblin Tour with me. On most weekends I want to do a century in miles. That would be four loops at 40 km. The lead in from Jetton would cover the 0.2 km needed.
