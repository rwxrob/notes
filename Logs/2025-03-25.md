Thinking a lot about sustainable volume for my goals again this morning. I really love watching the sun come up while sipping on this coffee with the quiet all around. Reminds me how much I used to ride in the early morning before it was even light out, often to get to Nike. I had to ride with horrible trafficâ€”I mean really horrible. Somehow I adapted. Yesterday I was reminded of one major reason I was able to do that. I had over the hear amazing beats headphones that made every long ride into an amazing music session as well.

After today's ride I realized I only want to log things that are changes instead of forcing myself to write something after every ride. It's more about the experience and I want to shave as much time from things that don't need to be done as possible. In fact, I can use Strava for everything by using the private notes.
