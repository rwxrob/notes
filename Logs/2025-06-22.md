Decided to donate my beloved Salsa Marrakesh while figuring out which bikes to put into my "new" apartment now that I'm separated. It's only purpose was long-haul, slow bike touring and ultimately proved to just not fit into my riding style:

- too heavy for [performance adventure cycling](../Outdoor%20sports/Performance%20adventure%20cycling.md)
- bar-end shifting really sucks
- slow cycling sucks ass, no wind to evaporate sweat, dangerous

The biggest mistake I made with Keshy is thinking I wanted to ride slow. I never did.

I really want to work up to 90 minutes of yoga in my life again (including 20 minutes of Savasana). I'd rather my life be defined by practicing all eight-limbs of Ashtanga every day than anything else. Yoga saved me after the first divorce and gave me a foundation upon which to build. It was the main connection I had with Doris. Ironically, my losing yoga regularly in my life might well have been the very thing that caused me to break leading to our separation. I really cannot allow that again.
