Got a morning Goblin Attack ride in before the thunderstorms. I think that is a new thing. 11:30 am rides work out better logistically on so many levels:

- I'm back for afternoon meetings
- I have the early morning to get focus work done
- I miss the bitter cold of early morning
- I miss the unbearable heat of Summer NC afternoons
- Traffic is so pleasant I can run most lights and stop signs
- Visibility is high so less need for safety precautions

My average total ride time is dropping closer to two hours these days for 60km. That will only improve meaning a 2.5-hour break is very doable. Since I'm so close to the bike shed it takes less than 30 minutes to change in and out of my gear and shower at home before starting to work some more.

The real question will be finding time to do leg strength training. I suppose on those days I could just do a really slow and easy recovery ride way later in the day around 4:30. When Winter comes I will likely mix things up based on the weather and do strength on the really had weather days.

Swiss Side is running a free aluminum wheel set offer for any high-end carbon set and since I already bought the Hadron I asked them if they counted and they said yes, so I am getting a $400 aluminum wheel set *in addition* to the fastest cheap wheels on the market. I'm so freaking excited to get them. I hope the Trump tariffs don't screw up delivery.
