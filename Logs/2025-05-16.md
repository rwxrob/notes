This morning I woke up with a really acute inflammation attack. My belly distended, all my skin including top of my scalp and hands itching, eyes on fire. I am very familiar with these attacks. I used to have them pretty much most of the day every day. I am absolutely baffled as to why.

- I have been walking with Doris and the dog past Crete Myrtle that did cause my throat to swell, maybe some stayed on me
- I have been experiencing high mental stress levels last two days
- I did not ride my bike for very long yesterday, just test riding fixes for the upcoming Gran Fondo
- I didn't take a shower yesterday
- I spent most of the day in my apartment that is full of dog hair, pollen, and mold
- I ate the usual foods, nothing to trigger an attack
- I had a really hard time concentrating on anything at work (brain fog)

I have noticed that going for a bike ride of any length that requires me to sweat during the day cures me from these symptoms every single time. I haven't figured out why. It's like my petulant body is throwing a fit because it doesn't get to play outside. "Fine, then I'm going to attack myself." I know of a guy on Twitch who does Zwift daily and if he doesn't his joints cease. He has a different condition but it reminds me of what I think I have.
