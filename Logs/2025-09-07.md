Reminded recently how weird live streaming in public is unless it is on a bike or some other type of event where wearing a camera looks normal. This is important since Moblin is horrible for streaming anything but pristine mobile signal areas (no matter how much people with much lower standards claim otherwise).  Low-signal situations demand Belabox and 2-3 high-powered dedicated mobile hotspot modems or even a Starlink.
