Reminded recently how weird live streaming in public is unless it is on a bike or some other type of event where wearing a camera looks normal. This is important since Moblin is horrible for streaming anything but pristine mobile signal areas (no matter how much people with much lower standards claim otherwise).  Low-signal situations demand Belabox and 2-3 high-powered dedicated mobile hotspot modems or even a Starlink.

I have no problem with stealth streaming from a phone. People may be uncomfortable with a camera directly in their face but they are all being captured on video by 100s of cameras operated by complete strangers able to do whatever they want in secret. This is why even looking at yourself in the camera while checking out at a store or getting cash from a bank makes *everyone* so uncomfortable. We all want to control how the world sees us but it is a complete illusion. Unfortunately, public privacy is completely dead. No privacy-theater laws will ever be able to put that cat back in the bag. As soon as you leave your home, everything you do is visible to all kinds of people including any government with a reasonable satellite system that can see the same amount of detail as a drone flying a meter above you. Most people don't freak about about it because they forget about it. Seeing yourself on camera—or seeing a camera pointed at you—forces you to realize this triggering your feelings of One more hidden camera operated by a person who is not quietly and secretly using that video—without any authorization—to do whatever they want is *not* worse than what already is but there is no reason to trigger people unnecessarily.
