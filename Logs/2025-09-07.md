Reminded recently how weird live streaming in public is unless it is on a bike or some other type of event where wearing a camera looks normal.

Low-signal situations demand Belabox and 2-3 high-powered dedicated mobile hotspot modems or even a Starlink.

I have no problem with stealth streaming from a phone.
