I guess you have to shoot big and fail to really test yourself and learn. This morning as I go about my normal morning routine I realize just how big a failure that entire "digital nomad by bike" plan turned out to me. More importantly, I understand all the reasons why which has informed what has become the most successful year I've had in a while now.

- Attempted out of desperation
- Daily routine was impossible
- Sleep quality would have been horrible
- Costs were overwhelming
- Danger was real
- Absence from Doris was unsustainable
- Livestreaming was a mistake

***Attempted out of desperation.*** The only reason I even attempted it was because I desperately needed to get out of that apartment prison. That was the motivator. It made me irrationally optimistic that I could make it work.

***Daily routine was impossible.*** Realizing this is what triggered this memory. I would have had to wake up, break camp, then bike someplace where I could work for eight hours, then conclude work, find a place to sleep, and do it all over again. Add in the complexity of finding enough calories to fuel a 3-5 hour bike ride every day and the weather and you get a completely impossible daily routine. Hell, just biking three hours per day during sunlight is hard enough.

***Sleep quality would have be horrible.*** 

***Costs were overwhelming.*** I spent probably double the money I spend this year on two new, low-end bikes and kit to setup everything I thought I needed to live like that. Plus then I was doing to spend a ton more on food on the road and lodging. I still think this would have worked out if that was my only expense but it wasn't. I still had to pay for an apartment, car, insurance, and all the rest. The cost of food is radically lower now and the quality of the nutrition much higher.
