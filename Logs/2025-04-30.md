This morning's beautiful routine and sunrise has reminded me what a catastrophic failure my attempt at DNB living turned out to be. The contrast to this year is overwhelming and laughable at this point.

I absolutely cannot overstate how big an impact my [custom gel nutrition](../Cycling/Homemade%20gel%20recipe.md) has had on my training recovery and results. I finish each three hour rideâ€”even ones with hionly lightly winded and ready to go on about my day doing other things and by the next day it practically feels like I didn't even do anything the day before. The contrast is so stark I'm realizing just how badly I've been doing on my training nutrition my whole life. Yesterday I took in even more carbs than the day before and felt even better during and after the ride. It's downright miraculous. I kinda want to shout this discovery from the rooftops to all the other endurance athletes out there, "You don't have to suffer!" I won't though. The ones who do the work and research will find it on their own and benefit. I'm done rewarding lazy people who don't do their own work to discover their own solutions. Just putting this log out there is enough.
