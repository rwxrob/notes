I guess you have to shoot big and fail to really test yourself and learn. This morning as I go about my normal morning routine I realize just how big a failure that entire "digital nomad by bike" plan turned out to me. More importantly, I understand all the reasons why which has informed what has become the most successful year I've had in a while now.

- Attempted out of desperation
- Daily routine was impossible
- Costs were overwhelming
- Danger was real
- Absence from Doris was unsustainable
- Livestreaming was a mistake
