This morning's beautiful routine and sunrise has reminded me what a catastrophic failure my attempt at DNB living turned out to be. The contrast to this year is overwhelming and laughable at this point.

I absolutely cannot overstate how big an impact my [custom gel nutrition](../Cycling/Homemade%20gel%20recipe.md) has had on my training recovery and results. I finish each three hour ride—even ones with intervals included—only lightly winded and ready to go on about my day doing other things and by the next day it practically feels like I didn't even do anything the day before. This is such a win compared to having to abandon rides after three hours before trying to choke down a mouthful of gummy bears or salted nut rolls or whatever hyper-inflated "performance" snake oil drink is out there. The contrast is so stark I'm realizing just how badly I've been doing on my training nutrition my whole life. I used to think Cytomax's fancy chemical makeup is what countered muscle soreness. I now realize my muscles were simply underfed. The solution is easy: digestible carbs that don't dehydrate you. That's what my super gel does. I made an entire weekly batch of gel flasks yesterday and I took in even more carbs than the day before and felt even better during and after the ride. It's downright miraculous. I don't think I'll have a problem pushing up to 100g or more this way (coinciding with normalized ride power increases). I kinda want to shout this discovery from the rooftops to all the other endurance athletes out there, "You don't have to suffer!" but I won't. This is it. The ones who do the work and research will find it on their own and benefit. I'm done rewarding lazy people who don't do their own work to discover their own solutions. Just putting this log out there is enough.
