This morning's beautiful routine and sunrise has reminded me what a catastrophic failure my attempt at DNB living turned out to be. The contrast to this year is overwhelming and laughable at this point.

I absolutely cannot overstate how big an impact my [custom gel nutrition](../Cycling/Homemade%20gel%20recipe.md) has had on my training recovery and results. I finish each three hour ride—even ones with intervals included—only lightly winded and ready to go on about my day doing other things and by the next day it practically feels like I didn't even do anything the day before. This is such a win compared to having to abandon rides after three hours before trying to choke down a mouthful of gummy bears or salted nut rolls or whatever hyper-inflated "performance" snake oil drink is out there. The contrast is so stark I'm realizing just how badly I've been doing on my training nutrition my whole life. I used to think Cytomax's fancy chemical makeup was what countered muscle soreness. I now realize my muscles were simply under-fueled. These days I don't get muscle soreness _at all_ because I anticipate it and fuel up before it happens but even when I forget the gel addresses the soreness so quickly that reacting to it also works. The solution is easy: digestible carbs with the highest scientifically possible glycemic index that don't dehydrate you. That's what my super gel contains. I made an entire weekly batch of gel flasks yesterday and I took in even more carbs than the day before and felt even better during and after the ride. It's downright miraculous. I don't think I'll have a problem pushing up to 100g or more this way (coinciding with normalized ride power increases). I kinda want to shout this discovery from the rooftops to all the other endurance athletes out there, "You don't have to suffer!" but I won't. This is it. The ones who do the work and research will find it on their own and benefit. I'm done rewarding lazy people who don't do their own work to discover their own solutions. Just putting this log out there is enough.

I have also learned to _not_ eat a lot of carbs _off the bike_. There are a lot of videos these days about cyclists becoming diabetic. The reason is because they are doing fueling completely wrong. Rather than properly fueling _during the activity_ they try to make up for it by fueling before or after the activity. This is so ass backwards and makes no sense whatsoever when you actually look at the nutritional science (which none of them do for some reason). All this "carb loading" stuff is absolutely stupid and wrong. Eating a balanced regular meal—that is actually low in carbs—tops off all the carb stores for anyone *if they have been fueling on the bike properly*. All carb loaded does is break your body by making it insulin resistant. Sending insulin to the cells screams "perform, perform, perform" but the cells are like "we aren't doing anything right now, why would you tell me to 'perform' when there are no stressors, I'm not listening to you anymore." The fix for this is to produce the least amount of insulin possible off the bike and only produce it when there are actual reasons to "perform" on the bike. This is why a balanced diet including fat, protein, and fiber is best even immediately after exercise to slow the body and insulin production down. Taking a very fibrous Huel shake as I literally step off the bike sends all the right signals to my body "we are done now, start rebuilding and tell the pancreas to chill out." I think of it as letting my metabolism warm down along with the rest of my body. I don't need the engine primed and ready to take in that high-octane for maximum performance. I need it to idle safely and efficiently now.

I'm blown away by how direct the corollaries are between car racing and endurance sports. The chemical composition of the fuels are radically different but the scientific approach to performance enhancement by having the right fuel for a given activity is astoundingly similar. My gel is almost literally high-octane fuel like that injected directly into the power producers of a mechanical engine. Obviously, the carburetor in a human is mechanically different but even the root _carbo_ (referring to Carbon) is the same. A carbohydrate is fuel (glucose) made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Gasoline is also a carbon-based fuel (hydrocarbon) mixed with air in the carburetor before being injected for combustion which breaks it down explosively. The result is watts of work for both.

Now let's look at high-octane mechanical fuel:

• High-octane fuel **doesn’t provide more energy per unit**, but…
• It’s **more stable under compression** and **resists premature detonation**
• That matters **only in high-compression, high-RPM, high-performance engines**
• In a cold or low-RPM engine, high-octane is **wasted potential**

Sound familiar? This is exactly what performance gel is. With the highest possible glycemic index (rate of absorption) into the engine it directly correlates to high-octane gasoline.
