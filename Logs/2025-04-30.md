I guess you have to shoot big and fail to really test yourself and learn. This morning as I go about my normal morning routine I realize just how big a failure that entire "digital nomad by bike" plan turned out to me. More importantly, I understand all the reasons why which has informed what has become the most successful year I've had in a while now.

- Attempted out of desperation
- Daily routine was impossible
- Costs were overwhelming
- Sleep quality would have been horrible
- Danger was real
- Absence from Doris was unsustainable
- Livestreaming was a mistake

***Attempted out of desperation.*** The only reason I even attempted it was because I desperately needed to get out of that apartment prison. That was the motivator. It made me irrationally optimistic that I could make it work.

***Daily routine was impossible.*** Realizing this is what triggered this memory. I would have had to wake up, break camp, then bike someplace where I could work for eight hours, then conclude work, find a place to sleep, and do it all over again. Add in the complexity of finding enough calories to fuel a 3-5 hour bike ride every day and the weather and you get a completely impossible daily routine. Hell, just biking three hours per day during sunlight is hard enough.

***Costs were overwhelming.*** I spent probably double the money I spend this year on two new, low-end bikes and kit to setup everything I thought I needed to live like that. Plus then I was doing to spend a ton more on food on the road and lodging. I still think this would have worked out if that was my only expense but it wasn't. I still had to pay for an apartment, car, insurance, and all the rest. The cost of food is radically lower now and the quality of the nutrition much higher.

***Sleep quality would have be horrible.*** One of the best things about my daily routine now is that I can have the highest quality sleep possible whenever I need it for recovery. This has been a _major_ factor in my health recovery and ability to keep doing it every day. There is simply no way my sleep quality would ever have been nearly as good constantly sleeping wherever I could find and feeling unsafe doing it.

***Danger was real.*** Sleeping near urban areas had the danger of vagrants unless I stayed in a campsite for $30 per night. Sleeping in remote locations had the danger of isolation and bears, yes bears. Those dangers practically disappear if I do a similar activity with a group of two or more other people—even better—when I do them with an organized, supported event. When I caught Covid on my car trip I realized just how vulnerable I was out there alone. I could hav
