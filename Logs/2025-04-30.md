This morning's beautiful routine and sunrise has reminded me what a catastrophic failure my attempt at DNB living turned out to be. The contrast to this year is overwhelming and laughable at this point.

I also cannot stop thinking about how revolutionary my carb gel has beenâ€”particularly during training which I was not expecting.

- [Performance gel is high-octane fuel](../Cycling/Performance%20gel%20is%20high-octane%20fuel.md)
- [Fasted training is for morons](../Cycling/Fasted%20training%20is%20for%20morons.md)
- [Intermittent fasting is horrible for endurance athletes](../Cycling/Intermittent%20fasting%20is%20horrible%20for%20endurance%20athletes.md)

I find myself eating more of a very low glycemic index, almost ketogenic diet when off the bike because I never have to think about being under-fueled when on the bike. I feel like my body is catching on. When it gets a high dose of protein it seems to shift to repair and recovery mode almost immediately instead of wondering what is coming next. I tend to get sleepy around those times because it is signally me that it wants to close down for repairs temporarily. Often a short nap takes care of it and I wake up full of growth hormone which I can actually feel these days. In fact, it sounds silly, but the more I'm able to send specific signals to my gut about what my expected activities will be for the coming hours the more in harmony with my body I feel and the less revolt I get from my body usually in the form of inflammation. Another key indicator is how fast my hair and nails grow and how strong they are. This is as reliable as tree rings to see what is actually chemically happening in my body. In fact, if I don't have to shave and cut my nails once every week or so I'm out of balance. This I know.
