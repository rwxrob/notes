I guess you have to shoot big and fail to really test yourself and learn. This morning as I go about my normal morning routine I realize just how big a failure that entire "digital nomad by bike" plan turned out to me. More importantly, I understand all the reasons why which has informed what has become the most successful year I've had in a while now.

- Attempted out of desperation
- Daily routine was impossible
- Costs were overwhelming
- Sleep quality would have been horrible
- Danger was real
- Absence from Doris was unsustainable
- Livestreaming was a mistake
- Stress was insurmountably high

***Attempted out of desperation.*** The only reason I even attempted it was because I desperately needed to get out of that apartment prison. That was the motivator. It made me irrationally optimistic that I could make it work.

***Daily routine was impossible.*** Realizing this is what triggered this memory. I would have had to wake up, break camp, then bike someplace where I could work for eight hours, then conclude work, find a place to sleep, and do it all over again. Add in the complexity of finding enough calories to fuel a 3-5 hour bike ride every day and the weather and you get a completely impossible daily routine. Hell, just biking three hours per day during sunlight is hard enough.

***Costs were overwhelming.*** I spent probably double the money I spend this year on two new, low-end bikes and kit to setup everything I thought I needed to live like that. Plus then I was doing to spend a ton more on food on the road and lodging. I still think this would have worked out if that was my only expense but it wasn't. I still had to pay for an apartment, car, insurance, and all the rest. The cost of food is radically lower now and the quality of the nutrition much higher.

***Sleep quality would have be horrible.*** One of the best things about my daily routine now is that I can have the highest quality sleep possible whenever I need it for recovery. This has been a _major_ factor in my health recovery and ability to keep doing it every day. There is simply no way my sleep quality would ever have been nearly as good constantly sleeping wherever I could find and feeling unsafe doing it.

***Danger was real.*** Sleeping near urban areas had the danger of vagrants unless I stayed in a campsite for $30 per night. Sleeping in remote locations had the danger of isolation and bears, yes bears. Those dangers practically disappear if I do a similar activity with a group of two or more other people—even better—when I do them with an organized, supported event. When I caught Covid on my car trip I realized just how vulnerable I was out there alone. I could have been even worse. I did have my Spot with me to get evacuated but not having those risks at all—without giving up the fun of those activities—has made all the difference in the world.

***Absence from Doris was unsustainable.*** Just about every night my beautiful wife lays her head on the same couch pillow my lap and cozies up in my snoopy blanket to fall asleep while we watch something together. It's become one of the greatest joys of my life, stroking her magical, glistening, grey hair, feeling her relaxed breathing as she falls into a pure, deep sleep. It's like I'm tucking her in or rocking her to sleep. Almost daily I go on a walk with her and the dog along the lake and talk about anything and everything. I cannot imagine ever giving that up now. At the time Doris wasn't available. She was busy doing other important things that I support. But these days she's chosen this time with me and I've chosen to be with her. I'm very confident I could live for a long time without her but why. Why not enjoy every moment I can with her as we share our frustrations and triumphs on a daily basis. Isn't that what marriage is really all about? Why would I _ever_ sacrifice that just to suffer randomly on the road in some ugly town.

***Livestreaming was a mistake.*** If I'm honest, one of the driving motivators for that big adventure initially was to have something to livestream that would be fun. The livestream community could watch over me and make sure I was okay since I was solo. Lots of other livestreamers do this but they simply do not have jobs or lives outside of their livestreaming. Just the stress of doing the livestream daily—not to mention the cost and logistics requirements—made the entire experience completely unfulfilling. As much as I love my li
