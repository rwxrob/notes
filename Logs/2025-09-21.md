Woke up from a dream of me helping a mom and her boy at a SKILSTAK that I started in Logan, Utah. The location was someplace off of main street and there was a courtyard of some kind with other businesses around and a common area to gather and be social. I remember all the great feelings of smiling and helping a mother who cannot for the life of her help her son find his way in the world today. She had moist eyes for some reason and it wasn't until the end that I asked, "Is everything okay?" She was embarrassed and sheepishly declined to answer saying she had to go but was really grateful to have found me. I woke up not knowing if it was because she found me or some other trauma in her life, as if she had been so overwhelmed with trying to help her child that she loved more than life.

I woke happy, energized and full of answers about my future. It was like I was given a vision of what's to come somehow. It brought out a lot of questions, some answered, some more silly than others:

- What kind of teeth should I get?
- How do I fund everything?
- What's the timeline?
- Should I buy a house and use it or rent downtown?
- Should it be a non-profit?
- What it would look like?
- What should the name be?
- How would I organize the business?
- How would I approach mentored learning this time?
- What do I need to do to prepare?

"If you build it, they will come." As much as I don't care for baseball that movie focuses on the faith it takes to build something and then follow it through and letting the Universe do the rest.

Writing this the intense emotion has already passed somewhat from the conclusion of the dream. It was *so* visceral and real. I really feel like I was getting a direct message to make sure it happens, that everything else is actually leading up to it, that one or more people that I will meet in Logan directly need what I can offer including perhaps members of my own extended and immediate family.

The idea of a retreat would more doable in Logan than anywhere else and Logan is one of the fastest growing towns in the nation right now.
