Finished most of my remaining training plan leading up to Asheville. Been having a lot of success with [4 days on, 1 off](../Fitness/4%20days%20on,%201%20off.md). I was doing five days but that was too much for the amount of volume. I like it because I can adjust to 3 on, 1 off as I age. I do have some question about the science of doing that much volume and *then* doing the intensity on the fourth day but this is very specific to the very odd demands of [GFNats](../Fitness/GFNats%20winning%20strategy.md). Each race is basically three 10-20 minute races spread out over 5-7 hours depending on how much group riding happens.
