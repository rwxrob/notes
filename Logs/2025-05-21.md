Finished most of my remaining training plan leading up to Asheville. Been having a lot of success with [4 days on, 1 off](../Fitness/4%20days%20on,%201%20off.md). I was doing five days but that was too much for the amount of volume. I like it because I can adjust to 3 on, 1 off as I age. I do have some question about the science of doing that much volume and *then* doing the intensity on the fourth day but this is all very specific to [GFNats](../Fitness/GFNats%20winning%20strategy.md). Each race is basically four 10-20 minute solo time trials spread out over 5-7 hours. Really, these are just durability competitions. I can't think of any other bike race I've ever done where the winners are the ones who ride the *slowest* (getting the best recovery possible) between the time trials.

It's yet to be seen if there will be a penalty for not staying with the fast group but if so I still don't intend to keep up. The single worst mistake anyone can make in these events is going hard during the time between timed segments. I'm counting on the fact that being more recovered and mentally ready for essentially a solo 20 minute threshold time trial on a hot hill with no wind @105-110% is far more important than the aero gains of being in a fast group during that interval. It depends on the segment, of course. I'm also counting on the fact that there will always be a peloton of people willing to work together no matter what pace I want to do.

Realized I really have to be more consistent in my [morning routine](../Fitness/Morning%20routine.md) and specifically diet in order for weigh-ins and to really work.
