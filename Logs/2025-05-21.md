Finished most of my remaining training plan leading up to Asheville. Been having a lot of success with [4 days on, 1 off](../Fitness/4%20days%20on,%201%20off.md). I was doing five days but that was too much for the amount of volume. I like it because I can adjust to 3 on, 1 off as I age. I do have some question about the science of doing that much volume and *then* doing the intensity on the fourth day but this is all very specific to [GFNats](../Fitness/GFNats%20winning%20strategy.md). Each race is basically four 10-20 minute solo time trials spread out over 5-7 hours. Really, these are just durability competitions. I can't think of any other bike race I've ever done where the winners are the ones who ride the *slowest* (getting the best recovery possible) between the time trials.

It's yet to be seen if there will be a penalty for not staying with the fast group but if so I still don't intend to keep up. The single worst mistake anyone can make in these events is going hard during the time between timed segments. I'm counting on the fact that being more recovered and mentally ready for essentially a solo 20 minute threshold time trial on a hot hill with no wind @105-110% is far more important than the aero gains of being in a fast group during that interval. It depends on the segment, of course. I'm also counting on the fact that there will always be a peloton of people willing to work together no matter what pace I want to do.

Realized I really have to be more consistent in my [morning routine](../Fitness/Morning%20routine.md), specifically diet, in order for weigh-ins to work. I was a full kilo heavier than usual today until I realized I added 600ml of Huel shake and a larger coffee than usual. That's about a kilo right there.

Last few four hour sessions I have noticed that I actually feel better in the second half after I've crossed over 140 bpm and sort of stay there. In the early part of the ride it seems like my heart doesn't want to start up. I remember having this when I did a lot of running in 2020. I think it is a sluggish response to aerobic stimulus. If I do something that is very anaerobic my HR spikes very intensely almost immediately. It's like if I'm working under a certain threshold my heart is like, "meh, we got this" and doesn't even take it's feet off the table while sipping its morning coffee. I don't think spiking that hard is a good idea to get to wake the fuck up, so I've been working with my AI to come up with a better [warmup](../Fitness/Warmup.md). 

I also need to start eating earlier in the ride. I've been waiting to eat until after the first hour or so. Then, the hardest part of even a zone 2 ride is about half way in (1.5-2 hours) when it feels like most of my sugar stores are depleted and the food I have eaten hasn't made it to were it is needed yet. This seems compounded by poor circulation response in the first hour of the ride where not even the blood gets to where its needed yet. Taking an off-the-bike break at hour two to refill bottles seems to fix all this giving everything a chance to catch up but I feel like I could do better on the bike.

Speaking of off-the-bike breaks, part of training for these GFNats events needs to include forcing myself to take an off-the-bike break every 40k (25 miles) or so. If I'm going to simulate the conditions of the race accurately I should make adjustments for that. This might seem unnecessary and not providing any competitive advantage but knowing an off-bike break is coming every 40k allows me to do a lot of things on the bike that I couldn't normally:

- Carry only enough nutrition for 40k of riding
- Push the top end of my performance benchmarks since fully resting once every 40k (full HR recovery, etc.)
- Overestimate hydration slightly without fearing the need to pee

For this reason I'm working on a century training route that has off-bike stops with restroom and refueling every 40k that can be shortened to 4 hours for weekly training rides.

I've also been training gut on [foods available at most events and specifically GFNats](../Fitness/GFNats%20race%20nutrition%20secret%20strategy.md) so that I don't have to haul around my heavy custom nutrition solution the entire time. If these events were first-across-the-line competitions then I definitely would just bring my flask for the entire event and not stop. I've seen plenty of videos where those events are won simply by not stopping, ever. Frankly, I'm very glad that GFNats is not one of these *at all*.

I've noticed that ice in my bottles makes all the difference. I know there's no science to back it but I feel like drinks with ice are more hydrating. I definitely am inclined to drink more when I have it. I really hate the taste of warm water with anything in it.

Got tires for PION2 but am going to hold off on setting them up until closer to the event. Still deciding which wheel set to go with for Asheville. I'm getting a lot more stable with the 63m aero rims and there's not that much cross wind in the mountains (I'm guessing). There are, however, a ton of opportunities to just smash the descents in an aero position and enough flats to make a difference. The aero wheels could be extremely valuable when I need to solo to bridge across to a group that is needed an specific times. I'm much more likely to be solo on the GFNats stuff than ever in a group because of all the rest stops so having the 63s would be something of an equalizer much like aero gains for time trialing would be.

The question ultimately is how valuable are the aero gains on the timed segments for a specific race. 

Asheville T-1 is an aero-wheel no-brainer with 1% average, 7% max, and most of the climbing at 1-3%. At 6k total (less than 15 minutes total) this is my bread-and-butter. I do this shit every single day. That is going to be the single fastest group ride as well. I have every intention of staying with the lead group for as long as I can on that one.

Asheville T-2 only has 2k of climbing but it averages 10%. The other 8
