Fully recovered. I hate to change the flat before my ride later so leaving a bit earlier.

Ride was amazing. Absolutely perfect weather. Just a few observations:

- Need to remove as much of Shearer Road from my route between Greystone and Rocky River as possible. With 80psi in the tires it's murder at anything about 25kph. Also, that section tends to have more traffic and less shoulder.
- 60 km is not enough. I finished that in about two hours. I need to add another 10-20 km to the regular base route so that I'm riding for 2.5-3 hours.
- Absolutely zero need to fuel on entire ride. Did just barely have enough water though. I think I drank too much at the start because ended up peeing after the ride.
- 2.5 hours of zone 2 was only 90 TSS. I'm going to need to either add more riding, perhaps even on strength days, up the intensity on one or more, or really make sure I'm doing 180-200 on the weekend long ride. I'll probably do that latter because it trains all the performance while fatigued stuff.
- Used Trek Carback and it is so superior to Garmin Varia it's ridiculous. It has app that vibrates or makes my phone make a noise (which I can hear because I'm wearing bone-conducting headphones). It actually shoes long vehicles on the radar. It has an "all clear" sound and turns the Garmin green, which the Varia does not do. It uses USB C for charging (the reason I looked at it). It has a perfect attachment for the seat putting the light higher in the same position as you would see on a motorcycle.

I was rereading [2025-03-27](2025-03-27.md) where I started talking about being a  [shameless suburban sprinter](../Bikes/Shameless%20suburban%20sprinter%20(not%20anymore).md) and how "I'm not in it to beat anyone." That's all changed. Not only am [I competitive with myself](../Fitness/I%20actually%20am%20competitiveâ€”with%20myself.md) but I also want to kick everyone else's ass in my age group at Gran Fondo Nationals. I know it's a big goal, but a fun one. 

My wife laughs at me when I say I'm not that competitive with others. I definitely am and she knows it. I suppose its true. 

I sincerely do not judge others every time I meet them like some bike riders do. If they have hair on their legs will I judge them? Not in the way most people think. My wife and I discussed this on our walk with the dog the other night. It was a great conversation. Every one of us is constantly doing the same as a dog smelling another dogs butt. We are looking for our tribe, people who "smell" right, who we could immediately relate with with the least amount of words possible. It's just what it means to be human. I wrote about how [this just makes me chuckle](../Bikes/It%20just%20makes%20me%20chuckle.md) but I'm very aware of it now. Today I got a big energetic wave from a female cyclist in her kit on the opposite side of the road. I waved back (as always). In fact, I wave at everyone now, even motorists for now specific reason. I want to make them realize that we lycra wearers are just human members of a different tribe than them, even the tribe that for some reason feels the need to drive 55 in a 35 zone to pass me and slam their brakes at the upcoming stop sign 100 meters ahead, where I wave when I immediately meet them. I mean, why not.

Another thing we do is seek out our tribe online. I once thought DKLEIN was in a tribe I wanted to join. Now I'm like, nah. He's a great guy and I love just about everything about him. But the dude literally makes fun of a rider for doing what competitive riders to, attack off the front. He calls them "Johnny Turbo" and talks shit about that person because they are pushing the pace for the whole group. Ironically, that is _exactly_ what other tribes of bike riders do on their group rides. In fact, it's the _reason_ they even do a group ride, to test themselves against their friends in a fun way. Two completely different tribes, both very serious bike riders.

So what's my tribe? Well, based on my YouTube history it is people kicking ass in Gran Fondos all over the world, the age-groupers taking podium spots and ribbing their buddies pushing them all the way there with them. These people are competitive as hell, but fun. They have their own language, one I once knew and I'm noticing has morphed somewhat. They have their own gang signs, like twitching an elbow to signal it is time for the next guy to pull, yet another insider word.

One YouTuber summarized the attraction of this hobby and tribe. He said something like, "blasting down this descent on entirely closed mountain roads is why we do it" because otherwise you simply cannot. These USA Cycling sanctioned events are always on roads that are patrolled even if they have traffic to keep the cyclists more safe and some even close down the major roads for the events because the peloton is too big to let any cars on those roads. That's right. An organized, serious Gran Fondo is the equivalent of a massive, high-speed Critical Mass except we take over the best, most scenic and interesting roads in the area. That's why I do it. That's why I want to get fit enough to keep up with [the "certified weapons"](https://youtu.be/IX-Hkn27orI?si=g3RrcHBFa5kAJddz&t=222) of the world, maybe I can even become one for my age group. (That video makes me want to do videos again, a bit.) Good way to review my own progress and stuff.

Playing with different tire pressures on the [wheel set wish list](../Bikes/Wheel%20set%20wish%20list.md). Max is 90 psi (which I tried today just to see what it felt like). I'm convinced that 72-75 front and 75-78 for rear is best going on the low side when rain or really rough roads. I'm running tubes so can't go much lower or will snake bite. The weight difference between tubes and tubeless is absolutely negligible for me. It's the feel and grip that I sacrifice somewhat. I run Butyl rubber because it has the lowest rolling resistance and can actually be repaired easily if something goes wrong. I am, however, strongly considering running tubeless just because I plan on doing some Gran Fondos where the road conditions are more like Paris Roubaix or are out west where goat head thorns are everywhere. I want to go through the motions of setting up tubeless as well as repairing one. I will still be carrying a Butyl rubber tube and patch kit for when things fail, but just one.
