Perfectly executed training ride today. 80k in 3:08 for 112 TTS (about the top end of the TSS I can absorb per day and still train every single day). I finally have a pristine loop for all my training and a direct access route to get to it:

- [Unity Church Loop 15k](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/50530580)
- [Unity Church and Back 33k](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/50530830)

By doing three loops I get exactly 80k. The 15k loop distance is on absolutely perfect training routes more than half of which are official bike routes, well-paved, very light traffic, frequent other cyclists sighted, rolling with enough hills to do intervals. In fact, the 15k distance is idea for 3xSS long intervals.
