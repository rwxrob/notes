Switching to TrainingPeaks and Xert for all my logging and training data. I did notice an immediate limitation to all these computerized predictors of performance: they are all based on my power curves generated from previous activities. 

Comparing power curves is the holy grail of comparing specific individuals. If there were baseball cards for bike riders then would have the power curve instead of stats.

The problem with power curve accuracy is that they have to be based on "break through" power levels at each benchmark duration, FTP being 60 minute. So unless I have been actually _trying_ to hit a best effort for a different duration in the last 42 days (the typical power curve measurement cycle) then my power numbers won't be accurately high enough.

For example, Xert thinks I can only do 200 power over 60 minutes, which I absolutely know is wrong. It's more like 260 but to get Xert to automatically detect that FTP I have to produce a number of automatically detectable "break through" efforts. I like the automated calculation of FTP that Xert provides but it means that rather than doing a single FTP test I have to be putting some breakthrough focus every week for different durations. I figure this is a good thing to do during the competitive group rides.

Great hour long ride around town on the Davidson gravel cross country trail and greenways. Created the [Lake Norman Gravel and Greenways](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/50460769) route that I have really been enjoying from my mountain bike while my road bike is in the shop.
