Life is stabilizing again. Strong Rob is returning. It's funny that shortly after all the crying stopped I remembered that term for myself that I wrote in my journals years ago after my first divorce. I recently found a "Coming Back" document outlining what I was thinking and my commitments to myself and society after the first divorce and so much of it applies now.
