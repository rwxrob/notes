Life is stabilizing again. Strong Rob is returning. It's funny that shortly after all the crying stopped I remembered that term for myself that I first wrote in my journals years ago after my first divorce. I recently found a "Coming Back" document outlining what I was thinking and my commitments to myself and society after the first divorce and so much of it applies now. All the stuff about the Mormons is absolutely comical to read now given what the world now knows about that moronic, manipulative, straight-up evil cult. I'm so lucky I survived with as much of my life and relationships with my children that I did.

Here's the thing I wish I could get everyone to understand.
