Yeah, I'm looking at the [route](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/42816945) and [results](https://www.cheahachallenge.com/Race/Results/133850#resultSetId-460742;perpage:100) for 2024 Cheaha Challenge and adjusting my expectations. Only 22 in my age group finishing 136 km with 2135 of elevation in 4:13 with an averaged speed of 32 kph. The winner did it with 34 average kph. To qualify by being in top 25% I'd have to place in top 5. For me that would require another 30 FTP or so and probably dropping another 10 kilos to get my W/kg up. Plus I'm doing it on a bike that is 2 kilos heavier than what they will have.

32-ish kph test ride for 80k today was fun and painful. I realized a few things:

- My efficiency blows away a lot of people that I follow on Strava (less watts, more speed over same distance and elevation)
- I don't actually like going so fast that I can't enjoy the scenery even in a competition
- I'm not into suffering any more, though once upon a time I really was
- I really just want to be the
