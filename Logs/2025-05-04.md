Yeah, I'm looking at the [route](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/42816945) and [results](https://www.cheahachallenge.com/Race/Results/133850#resultSetId-460742;perpage:100) for 2024 Cheaha Challenge and adjusting my expectations. Only 22 in my age group finishing 136 km with 2135 of elevation in 4:13 with an averaged speed of 32 kph. The winner did it with 34 average kph. To qualify by being in top 25% I'd have to place in top 5. For me that would require another 30 FTP or so and probably dropping another 10 kilos to get my W/kg up. Plus I'm doing it on a bike that is 2 kilos heavier than what they will have.

32-ish kph test ride for 80k today was fun and painful. I realized a few things:

- My efficiency blows away a lot of people that I follow on Strava (less watts, more speed over same distance and elevation)
- I don't actually like going so fast that I can't enjoy the scenery even in a competition
- I'm not into suffering any more, though once upon a time I really was
- I really just want to be "happy fit" instead of "kick ass fit"

These new epiphanies create quite a quandary in my mind. Bike touring has its appeal but lacks a focus on performance. Gran Fondos have a focus on performance and competition but lack scenic appeal. All this just reminds me of Dustin Klein, again. He is constantly pushing himself toward better performance but also has a pretty serious aversion to competition. He also prefers gravel rides. It makes me wonder if I should give gravel another look. The very nature of gravel slows the roll considerably but not so much that you overheat and sweat out like mountain biking. There's no posting 75 kph max speeds like I do on my road bike.
