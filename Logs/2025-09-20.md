I'm realizing driving to fitness destinations has some potential benefits:

- Eliminates the danger of traffic on my body and soul
- Allows me to heat up in the car immediately after the ride and relax while recovering
- Helps me meet new people that like to do what I do
- Gets me out away from the house a safe distance for live streaming
- Keeps my car battery charged
- Keeps my car logistics dialed in

I didn't realize how much I absolutely love cranking up my heat in the car after a hard ride while driving home and listening to music.
