Today rethinking my obsession with road cycling and move to just enjoying the ride and preparing for BNSUS eventually.

- I don't need an event to ride even the same routes
- I really don't willingly riding in the rain unless it's a super special thing like BNSUS
- Not as afraid of traffic as I was in previous years
- Bike Nonstop US appeals to me the the most now
- I wanna be more like DKLEIN but while live streaming
