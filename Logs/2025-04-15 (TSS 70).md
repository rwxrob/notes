Definitely recovered but mentally stressed about work and all the surguries i still need to setup. I am realizing that the best athletes have the least amount of shit happening in their lives and, frankly, the least amount of mental and emotional baggage from their current and previous life. Yesterday I wanted to kill someone when I found out that Mormon church has been lying about "not paying clergy" this entire time and that "general authorities" get a *tax free* stipend of $120,000 per year why saying over the pulpit that they are "not paid for their work." Fucking LIARS! I want *all* that tithing money back that I killed myself to pay them all those years.
