[I fucking hate adventure](../Cycling/I%20fucking%20hate%20adventure.md) and created [annual plan - 2025](../Cycling/Annual%20plan%20-%202025.md).

After dropping off some donation stuff to Trek and testing the electronic Di2 shifting I definitely want to upgrade to [Domane SLR 7 Gen 4](../Cycling/Domane%20SLR%207%20Gen%204.md) possibly even this year when the insurance money comes in. With tax and swapping out my 60mm cranks it will come in at $9000. I've been giving this *a lot* of thought and after a solid year of racing and legitimizing my obsession with competitive Gran Fondo riding it just makes sense that the single biggest component of that obsession (besides my body itself) would get the highest priority. With double incomes, double the bonus next year, and my car paid off—not to mention what will probably be a $75k settlement for the accident—it's not like we can't afford it. There's a million other justifications I could trot out but here's the thing: I don't need to. The one inanimate object that provides the greatest health and happiness in my life is worth it. Consider that people spend *way* to much on homes, cars, boats and RVs that are several times more expensive than this, depreciate, and don't come with ripped abs and a great ass as a side effect. As "toys" go this is the most practica
