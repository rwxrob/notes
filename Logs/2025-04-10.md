[I fucking hate adventure](../Cycling/I%20fucking%20hate%20adventure.md) and created [annual plan - 2025](../Cycling/Annual%20plan%20-%202025.md).

After dropping off some donation stuff to Trek and testing the electronic Di2 shifting I definitely want to upgrade to [Domane SLR 7 Gen 4](../Cycling/Domane%20SLR%207%20Gen%204.md) possibly even this year when the insurance money comes in. With tax and swapping out my 60mm cranks it will come in at $9000.
