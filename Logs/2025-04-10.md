[I fucking hate adventure](../Cycling/I%20fucking%20hate%20adventure.md) and created [annual plan - 2025](../Fitness/2025%20annual%20training%20plan.md).

After dropping off some donation stuff to Trek and testing the electronic Di2 shifting I definitely want to upgrade to [Domane SLR 7 Gen 4](../Bikes/Domane%20SLR%207%20Gen%204.md) possibly even this year when the insurance money comes in. The AL that I have now is "highest of the low-end" but what I really need is "lowest of the top end." With tax and swapping out my 60mm cranks it will come in at $9000 ($8000 with trade in on other). I've been giving this *a lot* of thought and after a solid year of racing and legitimizing my obsession with competitive Gran Fondo riding it just makes sense that the single biggest component of that obsession (besides my body itself) would get the highest priority and attention. With double incomes, double the bonus next year, and my car paid off—not to mention what will probably be a $75k settlement for the accident—it's not like we can't afford it. Just the health benefits alone are worth it. Other people my age are happy to reach their annual $7000 insurance deductible for all the shit they have broken in their bodies purely from entropy and apathy. (You just cannot tell them that to their face or they get pissed off and call you rude.) There are many more justifications I could trot out but here's the thing: I don't need to. Those are more than enough. The one inanimate object that provides the greatest health and happiness possible—to me or any other person with the same priorities going into old age as me—is worth at least as much as my annual health insurance minimum deductible. And the $300 annual USA Cycling membership includes zero deductible coverage for anything that happens to me or my bike while on the bike. Consider that people spend *way* to much on homes, cars, boats and RVs that are several times more expensive than this, depreciate, and don't come with ripped abs and a great ass as a side effect. As "toys" go this is the most practical purchase possible.

Did my first strength training in the gym today, just a bunch of sets of half-squats with calf raises at 8 reps and 200 lbs (4 45lbs plates + bar). Definitely glad I brought a weight belt. Makes all the difference. Wasn't bad at all. I hate the gym in general, but was nice to see my legs doing things, lol.

Just found out that Ride+ and Race+ USA Cycling membership does not cover the following:

- Any event with an entry fee that is not officially sanctioned by USA Cycling—including "partner" events
- Any damage to bike or gear (only body damage is covered)

I did confirm that the 0 deductible coverage includes any commuting or training rides—even in the suburbs.

Needless to say, this means that in the following events I am going to just be super chill and have fun rather than be super competitive and push the safety margin at all:

- Lake Norman Gran Fondo
- 24 Hours of Booty
- Love Valley Omnium
- NC Mountains to Coast

In fact, now that I think about it. In 2026 I'm *only* going to do Gran Fondo National series events with the one exception of the Lake Norman Gran Fondo since it is literally my training ride territory. I can do them all except Payson, Utah since it just isn't worth the trip and overlaps with Butler, NJ (much closer). I absolutely love that this series is very east-coast-centric.

I *knew* there was a reason I felt uneasy about the Assault on Mt. Mitchell. It's fucking dangerous (unchecked dogs, lights required for blind corner tunnels, horrible traffic on narrow roads) not managed well, over priced, has no police escort or coverage, and is not covered by *any* insurance. No wonder it's not sanctioned. It has the feel of a dangerous, overly popular event that just doesn't cut it.

Love Valley is out unless I really feel some crazy desire to enter it after the rest of the main events. I've decided not to do it. It's only $100 so dumping it doesn't hurt that much. The fact that there is gravel and killer descents and questionable riders with no insurance coverage kinda puts me in a place of, "naaaah." I'll give it a try this year and decide. I got nothing to prove to anyone who wants to suffer in freezing weather on gravel. Riding in a peloton is bad enough without the gravel aspect. I got shit I want to do (like 1st place at USA Gran Fondo Nationals for my age group). Risking a crippling injury to some local suffer-fest is not worth it, to me.

If there is one thing I have learned is that so many riders who look the part have no idea what they are doing. Honestly, I don't want to be anywhere near them. In fact, I want to take my peloton and bike handling skills to an even higher level. The quality of people entering USA Cycling officially sanctioned events is automatically a lot higher than everything else.

I'm getting so obsessed with the #1 podium position for nationals within the next five years that *anything* that distracts from it is starting to annoy me. For example, I bought a low-end trail bike to have fun on MTB trails in the area and have zero interest in riding them. MTB rides are simply not compatible with any training at all. This is so horrible to say, but I would actually prefer a Zwift mini-race for sprint training more than a MTB ride. At best they are fun things to do on the off days, like paddle-boarding. I keep hearing over and over again about MTB people getting completely sidelined with really bad injuries, like, *really* bad injuries. My slide out and losing skin is nothing in comparison. The teeth thing was something else entirely.
