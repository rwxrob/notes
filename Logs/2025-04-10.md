[I fucking hate adventure](../Cycling/I%20fucking%20hate%20adventure.md) and created [annual plan - 2025](../Cycling/Annual%20plan%20-%202025.md).

After dropping off some donation stuff to Trek and testing the electronic Di2 shifting I definitely want to upgrade to [Domane SLR 7 Gen 4](../Cycling/Domane%20SLR%207%20Gen%204.md) possibly even this year when the insurance money comes in. The AL that I have now is "highest of the low-end" but what I really need is "lowest of the top end." With tax and swapping out my 60mm cranks it will come in at $9000 ($8000 with trade in on other). I've been giving this *a lot* of thought and after a solid year of racing and legitimizing my obsession with competitive Gran Fondo riding it just makes sense that the single biggest component of that obsession (besides my body itself) would get the highest priority and attention. With double incomes, double the bonus next year, and my car paid off—not to mention what will probably be a $75k settlement for the accident—it's not like we can't afford it. Just the health benefits alone are worth it. Other people my age are happy to reach their annual $7000 insurance deductible for all the shit they have broken in their bodies purely from entropy and apathy. (You just cannot tell them that to their face or they get pissed off and call you rude.) There are many more justifications I could trot out but here's the thing: I don't need to. Those are more than enough. The one inanimate object that provides the greatest health and happiness possible—to me or any other person with the same priorities going into old age as me—is worth at least as much as my annual health insurance minimum deductible. And the $300 annual USA Cycling membership includes zero deductible coverage for anything that happens to me or my bike while on the bike. Consider that people spend *way* to much on homes, cars, boats and RVs that are several times more expensive than this, depreciate, and don't come with ripped abs and a great ass as a side effect. As "toys" go this is the most practical purchase possible.

Did my first strength training in the gym today, just a bunch of sets of half-squats with calf raises at 8 reps and 200 lbs (4 45lbs plates + bar). Definitely glad I brought a weight belt. Makes all the difference. Wasn't bad at all. I hate the gym in general, but was nice to see my legs doing things, lol.

Just found out that Ride+ and Race+ USA Cycling membership does not cover the following:

- Any event with an entry fee that is not sanctioned by USA Cycling
- Any damage to bike or gear (only body damage is covered)

I did confirm that the 0 deductible coverage includes any commuting or training rides—even in the suburbs.

Needless to say, this means that in the following events I am going to just be super chill and have fun rather than be super competitive and push the safety margin at all:

- Lake Norman Gran Fondo
- 24 Hours of Booty
- Love Valley Omnium
- NC Mountains to Coast

In fact, now that I think about it. I'll probably only do the Lake Norman Gran Fondo from now on and put only sanctioned events on the calendar for everything else.
