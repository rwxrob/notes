Bought a Rogue Barbell pad to take the edge off of heavy weight half-squats. Definitely need that. I don't want to worsen the strain on the contact point with my upper spine. I think doing squats instead of sled will produce the most benefit for all the other systems in my body besides just the legs including bone density and spine and core stabilizer muscles. I do need to do yoga daily for range of motion, internal organ stimulation, and stress reduction as well.

Testing out a Whoop to HRV to check for chronic overtraining. It's the single best indicator and cannot be accurately measured outside of REM sleep. As an amateur wanting pro results I need all the helpers I can get. I don't have a pro team to help out. It's $20/month but add it to the list of things that save me from 10s of thousands of dollars of reactive medical need later. Plus I can pay for it entirely with HSA since it qualifies.

I'm feeling the pull of obsession that takes me over when I get into something. If I'm not careful that obsession becomes a source of stress itself that detracts from my health in the past. Gotta watch that.

I knew the weight lifting would kill me. Just did 25k as slow as possible, lol. Took about an hour. I thinking of taking next week as recovery week.
