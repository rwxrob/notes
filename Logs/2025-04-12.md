Woke up with pretty damn sore quads. Reminds me of that one day I swore I couldn't walk after a hard leg workout at a kid in high school. Apparenty, [Z1-Z2 okay with sore muscles from weight training](../Cycling/Z1-Z2%20okay%20with%20sore%20muscles%20from%20weight%20training.md) so I will do two hours today of zone 2. I can wait for things to warm up later today.
