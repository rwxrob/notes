Woah, first real ride with the new aero Swiss Side carbon wheels and shattered most of my PR and KOMs on my Goblin route. 

In fact, I felt so much faster just averaging 210 watts that I can tell I need to plan a new route. As my watts, efficiency and form increase I'm going to need more long sections instead of all the stuff in the suburb. I see why cyclists who push even 250 average watts for zone 2 on an aero carbon bike avoid the suburbs more now than ever. Putting the aero wheels made me want more long straight farm roads with less "road furniture" shadows, potholes, and people randomly crossing because they don't see me coming. At those speeds suburbs border on just as dangerous or perhaps slight *more* dangerous. 30 kph (almost 19 mph) is really too fast to enjoy anything and when considering that most school zones and "people heavy" areas the speed limit is 15-20 mph the appeal of suburban sprinting starts to wane.

I created a route kinda based on the Lake Norman Medio Fondo to check it out. I have a feeling there are some sections that have way too much traffic still that will need to be adjusted.

I also put together an [essential Gran Fondo repair kit](../Cycling/Essential%20Gran%20Fondo%20repair%20kit.md) to practice carrying around with me. Might as well get used to it now. It should come in well under 300 grams total, about half a 550 ml water bottle in weight.

I've decided not to carry any of the lights I have and always just ride safely and with visibly kit during the day if needed. My Rudy helmet is rather visible all by itself. If anything, I might wear a flashing mini red light on the back of my helmet. During the day, though, those things are barely visible. Better, as science has proven, to wear really florescent socks instead where the motion is happening.
