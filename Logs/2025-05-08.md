Ugh. I feel terrible and wonderful. Wonderful because making some of best memories I could hope for with my kids including exchanging stories and music finds in a 10 hour car ride. Terrible because I've had alcohol two days in a row, completely blown my sleep schedule, still not adapted to the altitude, and digesting great foods my gut has no idea what to do with (sushi, seafood Alfredo, smoked almonds). Oh, and the Peloton bike here has the cleats filled in with some sort of permanent adaptor. I'm still going to try and get on it.

As for Cheaha Gran Fondo, well, that's turning into a fun long training ride with a big hill. Even with a few hours on the Peloton bike here at hotel there's really no way I'll be able to maintain any level of fitness this week let alone reduced weight. Honestly, this break from training has been important for me to reset my priorities and remind myself what I really want out of training, and life.

I love riding my bike. I write that a lot. But looking into the sunrise from this hotel drinking a nice Americana after having spend all this time with my kids I realize, again, that the joy of riding my bike pales in comparison to spending time with them. It's not like they demand or need my attention all the time. It's just super important that I make sure we can all get together once a year, at least. That they feel safe through these "uncertain times."

I started riding for my health, for myself but also for them. They need me, all of them, and that won't change for a very long time. It's not even the money thing. They need me for other reasons that are far more important and not something I want to write down here right now.

So why does this impact my Gran Fondo Nationals goals?

For starters it means that my [annual bike events](../Cycling/Annual%20bike%20events.md) have changed significantly. The cost has dropped from $2050 to $700 just for registrations. I re moved anything over 200 miles except for GFNat. Just by entering Asheville and Boone I'll qualify for Nationals even if I don't place high. I only need two. I just have to make sure that those three UCI sanctioned events are really good because my points will be entirely based on them alone.

Focusing on fewer events makes training a lot easier and more focused. If get race ready by mid July that fitness should carry me through mid September covering all the main events that I care about.

Fewer events also means I'm much more likely to be able to make them into family Summer vacation trips as well. Doris will definitely come with me to Asheville and possibly Boone, maybe even Maryland for Nationals. If she only came to Asheville and we made it into a weekend would be a lot of fun.

This year I've incurred a lot of expense to jump start my riding again:

- Endurance road bike
- Hard-tail trail mountain bike
- High-end aero wheel set
- Repaired all other remaining bikes (for others to ride)
- Gravel kit
- Casual kit
- Road kit
- Winter kit
- Helmet
- Poly-chromatic sunglasses
- Radar
- SPD shoes
- Winter road shoes
- Road-side repair kit
- USA Cycling Plus membership

I also signed up for *tons* of bike riding things not really knowing where I wanted to focus:

- 24 hours of booty
- NC Mountain to Coast
- RAIN
- All the Gran Fondo stuff

I'm pretty sure that cost me close to $10,000 in 2025. To be fair, all of that was covered by my performance bonus at work which I was not expecting to be as high as it was.

After 2025 all I have to do is maintain what I have
