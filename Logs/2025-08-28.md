Decided that most of my journaling will be in a private repo. I'll still keep stuff like the following here:

- Training observations
- Morning health status
- Event write ups
- Route discoveries
- Tech stuff

[I don't like tech. I like what it gets me.](../I%20don't%20like%20tech.%20I%20like%20what%20it%20gets%20me..md)
