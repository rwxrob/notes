After a lot of time in the hotel to rest and read and think I've concluded (again) that doing any intensity work with the goal of building a bigger engine is useless while hauling around 15% of extra body mass. The single easiest way for me to get faster is to focus on the "per kilo" part of "watts per kilo," not watts.

As hard as this is to type and do, this means that 100% of my training hours in 2025 will be nothing but low-to-mid zone 2 until I hit my target weight of 68 kilos (150)

In other words, I'm changing all my planning and targeted CTL values for all events and doing nothing as much low to mid zone 2 training as I can fit into a day without spiking cortisol levels until I weigh 68 kilos.
