After a lot of time in the hotel to rest and read and think I've concluded (again) that doing any intensity work with the goal of building a bigger engine is useless while hauling around 15% of extra body mass. The single easiest way for me to get faster at this time is to increase my watts per kiloâ€”especially since all my favorite riding depends heavily on it.

In other words, I'm changing all my planning and targeted CTL values for all events and doing nothing as much low to mid zone 2 training as I can fit into a day without spiking cortisol levels until I weigh 68 kilos.
