After a lot of time in the hotel to rest and read and think I've concluded (again) that doing any intensity work with the goal of building a bigger engine is useless while hauling around a 12 kilo trailer. In other words, I'm changing all my planning and targeted CTL values for all events and doing nothing as much low to mid zone 2 training as I can fit into a day without spiking cortisol levels until I weigh 68 kilos.
