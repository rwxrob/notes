After a lot of time in the hotel to rest and read and think I've concluded (again) that doing any intensity work with the goal of building a bigger engine is useless while hauling around 15% of extra body mass. The single easiest way for me to get faster is to focus on the "per kilo" part of "watts per kilo," not watts.

As hard as this is to type and do, this means that 100% of my training hours in 2025 will be nothing but low-to-mid zone 2 until I hit my target weight of 68 kilos (150 lbs). This was my standard weight for most of my teen years and through my 30s when I was a much more competitive rider and triathlete. I *must* get there again. I don't care how old I am.

Specifically, this means that that *only* time I am allowing myself to do any intensity is *during* the event itself and even then I've already decided that [Gran Fondos are for fun instead of competition](../Cycling/Gran%20Fondos%20for%20fun%20instead%20of%20competition.md). I'll take a full day or so to recover after the event and go back to as much long and slow as my body will allow per week, which could be as much as six hours per day based on what bike touring riders do when crossing the country. I'll be essentially doing a huge bike tour just on the same roads around here locally. It means that stopping for a light or whatever is totally fine. Staying on the lower end of zone 2 is safer than the upper end. I cannot risk even a small intensity spike because it robs me of hours disproportionately ok fat-burning riding I could be doing instead.

Working with my AI I've decided to split up the rides into two hour rides and just add more of them to the day. This is because stress and cortisol increase significantly after two hours.
