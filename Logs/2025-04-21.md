Woke up at 5:30 for some reason. Yesterday was really restful and I had a late two hour nap. I also had alcohol during the day that might have messed with sleep. I also suspect my body is adapting to the regular 9am training. I woke up naturally at 6am Saturday as if my body was an excited teen knowing it was going skiing that day. In fact, now that Summer is here I'm going to turn the morning "bunchy" (what the Aussies call a group ride) into a fatigued interval session by riding for about an hour of zone 2 before riding with the group at all and then potentially going with the short group that is more likely to have fun attacks and chases. Then I can finish out the rest of the time to cover the estimated length of most competitive Gran Fondos I'll be doing.

I feel like I need to dial in nutrition—especially carbs—for the race distance. I know that's a build phase sort of thing but yeah.
