Woke up at 5:30 for some reason. Yesterday was really restful and I had a late two hour nap. I also had alcohol during the day that might have messed with sleep. I also suspect my body is adapting to the regular 9am training. I woke up naturally at 6am Saturday as if my body was an excited teen knowing it was going skiing that day. In fact, now that Summer is here I'm going to turn the morning "bunchy" (what the Aussies call a group ride) into a fatigued interval session by riding for about an hour of zone 2 before riding with the group at all and then potentially going with the short group that is more likely to have fun attacks and chases. Then I can finish out the rest of the time to cover the estimated length of most competitive Gran Fondos I'll be doing.

I feel like I need to dial in nutrition—especially carbs—for the race distance. I know that's a build phase sort of thing but yeah. I've decided to only use 750 bottles on long training rides and use 550s for group rides and competition and just top them off. After studying Chris Miller's strategy the first two bottles will have electrolyte and carb and the refills will just be water to keep things simple. Carbs can come from 1 or two "sugar flasks" with my own homemade gel in them so that I can vary the water depending on the heat for the day. If I've pre-fueled properly and dialed in my fat-burning system and start relatively slowly that should mean that the first two hours are covered and I'll have to start taking on carbs from gel and water after that, so hours 3-5. Somehow I will have to train my gut to take in at least 90 grams of carbs per hour at 300 FTP tempo effort. So 3x90 or 270g which is about one 250ml flask. This means the only thing I need to do in the feed zones is refill water bottles and that's it. 

Put on 1.4 kilos of mostly fat. Could be Easter meal not fully digesting. Could be I'm fully hydrated now and wasn't before. Been taking weight measurement after eating the same breakfast every day and going to the bathroom. It's the most consistent I can manage. Taking a weight measurement after a workout—unless checking hydration—is not reliable.

Signed up for TrainingPeaks with the money I was going to spend on Whoop. Such a monumentally better use of that money, and cheaper.
