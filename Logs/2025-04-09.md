Here's the [best YouTube video](https://youtu.be/C6Em295TBFg?si=veniErwLJlWEY1OY) summarizing all the major things to know about getting good on the bike. I've seen or read pretty much all of it in other places but this is a great summary.

[Carbs burned per watt per hour](../Fitness/Carbs%20burned%20per%20watt%20per%20hour.md) is extremely misunderstood on the Internet by average people. Having a guide to carbs that includes average watts per hour helps make much more sane choices about how much to actually eat based on the duration of the effort and how hard it is.

I combined this into my [current FTP power zones (270 FTP)](../Cycling/Current%20FTP%20power%20zones%20(230%20FTP).md) so I can look at a planned ride and get a good guess as to my carbs needed for that ride.

Today's ride was totally new terrain for me. I've never been on the farm roads of the Lake Norman Gran Fondo. They are great, for the most part. I can tell I have a lot of exploration to do there. It wasn't uncommon to turn and then have 5km to go before the next turn in any direction. This provided a much more consistent workout and has left me more tired than the same distance with Goblin presumably because of all the slowing down I do for turns here and there and mandatory stops along the way.

I definitely spun out my top gear a few times.
