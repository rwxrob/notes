After a lot of contemplation I've decided to cancel my gym membership. I really hate it. The gym literally takes me out of nature and disconnects me from the world. It also is entirely based on _defeating_ my body instead of becoming one with it and tapping into its natural power. That sounds like a lot of hippy shit but that's just me.

I've really been enjoying these slow hard tail MTB rides around town on all the greenways and trail and gravel sections, so much so that I'm seriously considering light-weight MTB bike packing again. I've also realized that with my MTB shoes and gloves that I can do yoga pretty much anywhere out in nature which means I can bike to a remote spot and do some yoga. Now _that_ is something I really love.

Its funny because I did this _exact_ thing when I first got divorced. I got all swole in the gym, did yoga in a gym class, started doing Ashtanga daily, paddle boarding and mountain biking and never went back to the gym again. Looks like I'm doing that again.
