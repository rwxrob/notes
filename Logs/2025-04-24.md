After a lot of contemplation I've decided to cancel my gym membership. I really hate it. The gym literally takes me out of nature and disconnects me from the world. It also is entirely based on _defeating_ my body instead of becoming one with it and tapping into its natural power. That sounds like a lot of hippy shit but that's just me.

I've really been enjoying these slow hard tail MTB rides around town on all the greenways and trail and gravel sections, so much so that I'm seriously considering light-weight MTB bike packing again.
