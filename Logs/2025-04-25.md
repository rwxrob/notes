So a few notes about TrainingPeaks and Xert:

- Have Garmin send directly to TP and Xert so no duplicates
- Do _not_ automatically push from Strava to TP or Xert or data is actually lost
- Connect Xert to Strava, but click off any automatic imports, then select all activities and "Sync" once only
- Xert automatic FTP detection is almost impossible to override, focus on getting activities loaded correctly
- TrainingPeaks will update a planned activity from a Garmin activity automatically
- Often the TP TSS will need to be adjusted or added (usually best from the Xert XSS calculated value)

Did some non-recorded active recovery on new road bike with the new 160mm cranks and 52/34 rings. Upped seat about 60mm (since was at 172.5 before). Crank is definitely in my perfect range given my shorter leg length and overall comfort level spinning. Had to replace batteries of pedals.
