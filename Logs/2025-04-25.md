So a few notes about TrainingPeaks and Xert:

- Have Garmin send directly to TP and Xert so no duplicates
- Do _not_ automatically push from Strava to TP or Xert or data is actually lost
- Connect Xert to Strava, but click off any automatic imports, then select all activities and "Sync" once only
- Xert automatic FTP detection is almost impossible to override, focus on getting activities loaded correctly
- TrainingPeaks will update a planned activity from a Garmin activity automatically
- Often the TP TSS will need to be adjusted or added (usually best from the Xert XSS calculated value)
