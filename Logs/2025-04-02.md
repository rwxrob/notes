[Goblin 42k Sweet Spot Workout](../Cycling/Goblin%2042k%20Sweet%20Spot%20Workout.md) looking for a good spacing between sweet spot intervals. It's not perfect but it was really fun.

11am is the perfect time to go:

- As warm as its gonna get, pretty much
- Back in time for afternoon work and meetings
- No school traffic
- Greenways virtually to myself
- Missed afternoon thunderstorms

I attended a meeting that is mostly just listening while on the ride. Sound was flawless with earplugs and bone conducting headphones.

Also answered a phone call regarding move of ownership of the storage units/bike shed. Looks like going to be okay.
