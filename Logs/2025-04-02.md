[Goblin 42k Sweet Spot Workout](../Cycling/Goblin%2042k%20Sweet%20Spot%20Workout.md) looking for a good spacing between sweet spot intervals. It's not perfect but it was really fun.

11am is the perfect time to go:

- As warm as its gonna get, pretty much
- Back in time for afternoon work and meetings
- No school traffic
- Greenways virtually to myself
- Missed afternoon thunderstorms

I attended a meeting that is mostly just listening while on the ride. Sound was flawless with earplugs and bone conducting headphones.

Also answered a phone call regarding move of ownership of the storage units/bike shed. Looks like going to be okay.

Love this [Weight is going up](https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-training/inside-the-radical-weight-gain-theory-of-pro-cycling/) article talking about the very sane approach to nutrition and power that is becoming the new trend (even though it is pretty self-evident). Based on this and with the help of my AI and Jonas Abrahamsen stats I'm now going for 300 FTP at 72 kg and 9% body fat with a GC approach that favors explosive attacks and decent hill climbing, without becoming a full sprinter. I think [Jonas](https://youtu.be/4S-AzyMPha4?si=YsMA8U3EGhjB3BYh) would approve.

I love that the article calls out the need for aero gains way more that lower weight for overall performance since the equipment and power numbers that the entire cycling community is putting out are extremely high, the pros *climb* at 30 kph making aero way more important than weight. Plus extra power is always more generally useful then extra W/kg.

This has all made me want to get in the gym eventually. I'm still working out how that will happen. The first step is to reduce totally on-bike training during the weekdays to 90 minutes with a max of 2 hours per day. That will unlock several hours during the week. Then I can pile on long miles on Sunday and Saturday to dial-in endurance.

Honestly, if I never went to a gym at all and just made sure to have one sweet spot workout and one burst power workout on the bike every week I'd probably be just fine for everything I ever want to do.
