God I feel so great this morning! I really think it is the Orgain shake at night before bed. I swear *everything* repaired faster than usual. I feel like I did as a kid when I want to jump out of bed and go play! Seriously, I feel like I could do another 140k or a hard weight session without a problem.

I think the shake gives my body something to work with and the high protein content triggers repairs. Something about the 20g or pea protein and 15g carbs as a liquid that digests at the perfect rate, not to fast, not too slow. It doesn't affect my sleep or clog me up and ferment like other foods directly before bed. Chloe (my AI) uncovered a ton of scientific studies that back this up.

Speaking of sleep. Last night was wonderful! In fact, my sleep is so good and amazing since returning to the life of an endurance athlete that had I remembered that I would have made that life change for that reason alone. My dreams are frequent and vivid with deep REM. I wake up without an alarm at the same 7-8am every day fresh and full of new ideas and excitement. I wish I could shout this from the housetops—or better yet—let others just taste how amazing it feels so they can know it is possible—even at 57. Life is good when sleep is good. I'm so excited to see this with the Whoop I have coming. Yes, I am just trying it out but I'd rather have that than pay for a coach at this point. Amateur athletes with a full-time job and family and no coach need all the tools they can get to help them train.

I'm morphing into a lycra super hero but I don't mind. Actually, I am returning to 15-year-old Rob who would ride his bike 15 miles to a criterium and then race it and ride back because things like cars and car racks were completely out of my reality. I still have a vivid image of nestling behind a huge box truck and drafting almost the entire way home once. I often consider what if I had had the resources of some of these pros whose families sent them to pro race camp.

Anyway, I'm a roady. I did BMX around my house as a 10 year old but once I discovered road cycling and bought my first serious bike (a KMS which wasn't really that serious, just not from the store) after putting it on layaway and saving every single dollar for it and having my mom and dad give me my first pair of leather chamois *real* cycling shorts
