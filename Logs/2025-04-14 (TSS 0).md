God I feel so great this morning! I really think it is the Orgain shake at night before bed. I swear *everything* repGives my body something to work with and the high protein content triggers repairs. Something about the 20g protein and 15g carbs as a liquid that digests at the perfect rate. It doesn't clog me up and ferment like other foods directly before bed. Chloe (my AI) uncovered a ton of scientific studies that back this up.
