God I feel so great this morning! I really think it is the Orgain shake at night before bed. I swear *everything* repaired faster than usual. I feel like I did as a kid when I want to jump out of bed and go play! Seriously, I feel like I could do another 140k or a hard weight session without a problem.

I think the shake gives my body something to work with and the high protein content triggers repairs. Something about the 20g or pea protein and 15g carbs as a liquid that digests at the perfect rate, not to fast, not too slow. It doesn't affect my sleep or clog me up and ferment like other foods directly before bed. Chloe (my AI) uncovered a ton of scientific studies that back this up.

Speaking of sleep. Last night was wonderful! In fact, my sleep is so good and amazing since returning to the life of an endurance athlete that had I remembered that I would have made that life change for that reason alone. My dreams are frequent and vivid with deep REM. I wake up without an alarm at the same 7-8am every day fresh and full of new ideas and excitement. I wish I could shout this from the housetops—or better yet—let others just taste how amazing it feels so they can know it is possible—even at 57. Life is good when sleep is good. I'm so excited to see this with the Whoop I have coming. Yes, I am just trying it out but I'd rather have that than pay for a coach at this point. Amateur athletes with a full-time job and family and no coach need all the tools they can get to help them train.

I'm morphing into a lycra super hero but I don't mind. Actually, I am returning to 15-year-old Rob who would ride his bike 15 miles to a criterium and then race it and ride back because things like cars and car racks were completely out of my reality. I still have a vivid image of nestling behind a huge box truck and drafting almost the entire way home once. I often consider what if I had had the resources of some of these pros whose families sent them to pro race camp.

Anyway, I'm a roady. I did BMX around my house as a 10 year old but once I discovered road cycling and bought my first serious bike (a KMS which wasn't really that serious, just not from the store) after putting it on layaway and saving every single dollar for it and having my mom and dad give me my first pair of leather chamois *real* cycling shorts I never looked back. My dad, a mountain biker at heart, had to practically beg me to come on the Moab White Rim trip with him (for which I had to buy a mountain bike from the bike shop where I worked and had built my Paramount, wheels and all). I am so glad I did. I *loved* that trip. It was the first taste of would we would call cross-country now. I'm glad I did buy the Trek Roscoe with the Domane because eventually I will do so more of that. Still, nothing gets me more than pristine tarmac and a road bike. It's the same reason I liked motorcycles for a while the feeling of speed on my body with the wind pushing back and panoramic amazing scenery unfolding rapidly all around that I can take in. That's the appeal of road cycling and why the Tour de France, which started in Italy for the first time ever in 2024, is so fucking amazing even though being in the Peloton means you can't look up at the historic buildings for a second.

After yesterday's exploration I started a [local road rankings](../Cycling/Local%20road%20rankings.md) list. It helps so much to know what condition a road is before putting it on a long road route. Heat maps never tell the whole story. Some of the best roads have nothing on the heat map and some of the least safe and ugly roads have huge heat maps because people just don't know. I'm lazy and will work on it as I go.

Reading about this incident with [Luca Colnaghi in Italy](https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/luca-colnaghi-suffers-multiple-injuries-after-attack-by-two-motorcyclists/) and all I can say is that if that happened to me there would be serious, 1st-degree consequences for that kind of asshole. It's the only response these fucking morons understand. I would happily go to prison to ensure justice is served and the only message morons like this will understand. There is no "high ground" here. This is a Punisher scenario.

Ordered a Trek Carback radar (instead of Garmin Varia) just for the USB C charging and Blendr seat mount to raise it up somewhat. I'll still fun my Fenix red light as well. With a reasonably visible jersey (I refuse to wear neon) and my sparkly Rudy helmet I don't see how I can make myself any more visible from behind. I refuse to blind people with a headlight which just means I have to be super vigilant with what is coming up ahead. No amount of vigilance would have saved me from the parked to u-turn incident that knocked my teeth out but that never would have happened on the open farm roads out in the middle of nowhere. In those areas knowing what is behind you and being visible to whatever that is makes way more difference. In fact, for all but the most casual urban riding and super slow speed I think my days of riding the suburbs are over. I'm just too fast, lol.
