Recently I read this on the page of a fast bikepacking person that I follow:

> I pushed myself, met some great people, saw some unbelievable scenery, dislocated and self-located my shoulder with the help of my new friends, ate tons of junk food and covered 306 miles / 20,415' of beautiful Washington state (including 176 miles of new-to-me terrain). All of that on 4 hours of sleep.

Nothing about that appeals to me. In fact, I'm so turned off by the very idea of it that I thought seriously about selling or donating all my heavy touring and camping gear.

I'm realizing (again) what my preferred bike-riding style is:

- Focused on performance even when having fun
- Allows others to participate with their own goals
- Warm shower and cozy, comfy *bed* (no pads)
- Feels like riding a bike instead of turning the torture wheel
- Can be done every single weekend without huge expense
- A bit of bike-messenger feel

Doris used to say that she's "outsidey" (as opposed to "outdoorsy"). I feel like on the spectrum of being a "home body" to outdoorsy river guide that I'm closer to the outsidey spot than outdoorsy. I love being uncomfortable and out in nature, but I want to be *really* comfortable soon after that.

Yesterday after doing an easy 100k ride to Noda (outside Charlotte) and back and while I was blinded by the sweat stinging my eyes I realized that if I wasn't able to have a shower and get out of those wet clothes immediately that it would have been *miserable*. I know that the bikepacking people have a whole rehearsed routine for converting into a cozy nights sleep, but all the work to find a place, setup camp, get cleaned up, and get food while worrying about some animal or human visiting would take a completely wonderful bike ride and make it much less fun. Plus it would prevent me from pushing my hardest during the ride itself. As I lay there in my super warm and cozy bed, all fresh and clean, savoring the popcorn I made and a cold beer while basking in the glow of Strava reviewing my ride it was really clear this is what I like.

For some reason I keep getting reminded that this is *me*.

- I'm not a competitive lycra super hero who can't look away from the peloton for fear of crashing
- I'm not an ultra-slow tourist with 60 lbs of gear looking at everything and barely realizing they have a bike
- I'm not an insane downhill mountain-biker
