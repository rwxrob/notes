Today was the first day with a Whoop. It says I'm fully recovered, already. Here's the thing. I did a 2.5 hour base ride yesterday and I barely feel tired or sore now. I could easily do another one today. Dillon Johnson says he assesses what to do every morning based on how he feels. I think I'm going to generally do the same.

I've been reminded that I don't do anything active all day, nothing stressful except maybe a bit of mental stress from work. This means that even a two our Z1-Z2 ride is nothing more than what most people would do during the day at their jobs in addition to whatever training they are doing. In other words, getting on the bike for two hours a day—everyday—should not impact anything. Then I can vary the intensity for the training element of it.

I also think I am going to start heading out much earlier, leaving at 9am instead of 10, which I had already pushed from 11am. According to my AI, 8:45 to 2:30 is the optimal window to be on the roads during school season, preferably before lunch traffic around noon. The biggest problem is the temperature in the edge seasons at that time. 9am is still cold, not as cold at 7am, but cold. I don't like going on training rides when I have to switch up my clothes during the ride but I _need_ to get really good at that since most Gran Fondos and group rides start in the cold hours before 9am.
