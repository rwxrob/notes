Going to ride from [Davidson to Asheville following the shortest route (193k)](../Fitness/Davidson%20to%20Asheville%20(Shortest).md) this coming weekend and meet my wife there for a date, then she can bring us home. Despite all the route planning and fitness preparation I'm a bit nervous, just enough to make it an adventure. I won't be carrying anything with me except food and water and a very basic seat pack. Pretty sure I have phone signal for all of it but we'll see about that.
