Going to ride from [Davidson to Asheville following the shortest route (193k)](../Fitness/Davidson%20to%20Asheville%20(Shortest).md) this coming weekend and meet my wife there for a date, then she can bring us home. Despite all the route planning and fitness preparation I'm a bit nervous, just enough to make it an adventure. I won't be carrying anything with me except food and water and a very basic seat pack. Pretty sure I have phone signal for all of it but we'll see about that. For some reason the unknown of it makes it more scary than about the same distance I do all the time around here. I felt the same way when I first started doing the Goblin routes and they were only 40k originally. Now I have the cracks on every stretch of road for Goblin memorized. 

Eventually I hope to memorize every different option to get from Davidson to Asheville. There are years of adventures just trying all the different routes and documenting them. 

Unfortunately, I don't think the return trip from Asheville to Davidson will ever be realistically possible given the timing of when I'll be on the busiest roads returning to Davidson so I'll just have to keep asking Doris to drive to Asheville and do stuff there.

Decided to willingly [ride in the rain](../Fitness/Riding%20in%20the%20rain?.md) to increase my toughness. I've also decided to [never ride with a group again](../Fitness/I%20hate%20pelotons.md) and change my default bike setup to be for all-road [performance adventure cycling](../Fitness/Performance%20adventure%20cycling%20FTW.md). I might still do Gran Fondos every year, but we'll see. I'm not married to the idea. I'd rather plan epic, fast trips to interesting places and meet my wife there or travel with friends who are focused on individual performance and enjoying the ride above all. I have been really remembering recently how much [I hate pelotons](../Fitness/I%20hate%20pelotons.md). So looks like planning to use my [all-road PAC bike setup](../Fitness/All-road%20PAC%20bike%20setup.md) more and not even tempted by the Madone or other race bikes. In fact, for Gran Fondos I've signed up for I'll be removing the pack and aerobars, otherwise, I'm always riding with them on because I want to get used to using themâ€”especially in very high head winds as I will encounter crossing the country. I am swapping out my road shoes for my SPDs and putting [50-50 all-road tire](../Fitness/Best%2050-50%20all-road%20tire.md) that I would use to cross the country on BNSUS if I ever do that.

The biggest change to my mindset of late is that traffic is not as dangerous as I thought if you pick the right routes and maintain a very high speed. The BNSUS route has convinced me of this. This year 39 people so far are signed up for Washington DC (the safer route with gravel) while 26 are signed up for the classic TransAm (where people have 1 in 50 chance of dying based on past stats, last year Leah Goldstein was charged by a black bear in Kentucky). I really hope they film the whole thing this year. The popularity of the new gravel route is consistent with the rise of gravel in America. It's not as intense as Tour Divide but has all the best parts of a competitive race across America West to East. I really want to do it.
