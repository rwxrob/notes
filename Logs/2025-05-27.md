Going to ride from [Davidson to Asheville following the shortest route (193k)](../Fitness/Davidson%20to%20Asheville%20(Shortest).md) this coming weekend and meet my wife there for a date, then she can bring us home. Despite all the route planning and fitness preparation I'm a bit nervous, just enough to make it an adventure. I won't be carrying anything with me except food and water and a very basic seat pack. Pretty sure I have phone signal for all of it but we'll see about that. For some reason the unknown of it makes it more scary than about the same distance I do all the time around here. I felt the same way when I first started doing the Goblin routes and they were only 40k originally. Now I have the cracks on every stretch of road for Goblin memorized. 

Eventually I hope to memorize every different option to get from Davidson to Asheville. There are years of adventures just trying all the different routes and documenting them. 

Unfortunately, I don't think the return trip from Asheville to Davidson will ever be realistically possible given the timing of when I'll be on the busiest roads returning to Davidson so I'll just have to keep asking Doris to drive to Asheville and do stuff there.

Decided to willingly [ride in the rain](../Fitness/Riding%20in%20the%20rain?.md) to increase my toughness. I've also decided to [never ride with a group again](../Fitness/I%20hate%20pelotons.md) and change my default bike setup to be for all-road [performance adventure cycling](../Fitness/Performance%20adventure%20cycling%20FTW.md). I might still do Gran Fondos every year, but we'll see. I'm not married to the idea. I'd rather plan epic, fast trips to interesting places and meet my wife there or travel with friends who are focused on individual performance and enjoying the ride above all. I have been really remembering recently how much [I hate pelotons](../Fitness/I%20hate%20pelotons.md). So looks like changing my [all-road PAC bike setup](../Fitness/All-road%20PAC%20bike%20setup.md) and no longer even tempted by the Madone or other race bikes. In fact, I'm seriously considering putting the aerobars on my bike for the two Gran Fondos I've signed up for.
