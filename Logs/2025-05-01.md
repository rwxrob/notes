The nice thing about Strava is that you can kinda judge your efforts against those of others, including pros and the semi-pro amateurs in the area. I noticed that at 170 normalized power over 80k with comparable elevations I averaged 27kph while another guy who is significantly older than me averaged 25 with 250 normalized power, same distance and elevations. The number that Strava doesn't give out is body weight. If it did I'd probably see that my watts per kilo is better than his. Otherwise, I'm left wondering how the average watts could be so different. He's a highly trained athlete and has been for years unlike me coming back to it, but still. This is why FTP has a lot of flaws. It absolutely does not predict competitive performanceâ€”especially as events get longer. I'm glad I got to see this for myself. It could also mean that I'm substantially more efficient with how my watts are spent, which I assume is true in most cases give the wheels I'm running alone. In a peloton I will easily be able to maintain 32 kph on the flat and even at 78 kg (target by event) I will float up the hills. With my dialed in carb strategy I feel really good about my chances for a top ten in my age group.
