The nice thing about Strava is that you can kinda judge your efforts against those of others, including pros and the semi-pro amateurs in the area. I noticed that at 170 normalized power over 80k with comparable elevations I averaged 27kph while another guy who is significantly older than me averaged 25 with 250 normalized power, same distance and elevations. The number that Strava doesn't give out is body weight. If it did I'd probably see that my watts per kilo is better than his. Otherwise, I'm left wondering how the average watts could be so different. He's a highly trained athlete and has been for years unlike me coming back to it, but still. This is why FTP has a lot of flaws. It absolutely does not predict competitive performanceâ€”especially as events get longer. I'm glad I got to see this for myself. It could also mean that I'm substantially more efficient with how my watts are spent, which I assume is true in most cases give the wheels I'm running alone. In a peloton I will easily be able to maintain 32 kph on the flat and even at 78 kg (target by event) I will float up the hills. With my dialed in carb strategy I feel really good about my prep but we'll see what it gets me. If you take someone just like me but give them a 300 FTP I will likely be no where near their result. Right now I'm still going to keep focusing on W/kg and change body composition. I need to trim down to a stock endurance athlete vehicle before I can dial it in with performance enhancements like intensity sessions to boost FTP.

After a bunch of time setting up so many routines and plans I feel like everything is dialed in enough that I just have to follow the plan now. I find myself with a lot more time that I was using to come up with these routines and plans. I wrote about how my [Digital Nomad by Bike was a catastrophic failure](../Cycling/Digital%20Nomad%20by%20Bike%20was%20catastrophic%20failure.md) but now I'm feeling the pull of high-performance bikepacking.
