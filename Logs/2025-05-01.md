The nice thing about Strava is that you can kinda judge your efforts against those of others, including pros and the semi-pro amateurs in the area. I noticed that at 170 normalized power over 80k with comparable elevations I averaged 27kph while another guy who is significantly older than me averaged 25 with 250 normalized power
