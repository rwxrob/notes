Race week and I definitely have the jitters. I know I shouldn't. I'm prepared and know it will just be fun, but still. It's been a while since any kind of competition for me. I always get weird before a race even if it is just a fun gran fondo primarily for the experience. I used to do the same with triathlons and even simple 10k and 8k road races. Triathlons have the absolute largest amount of stress at the starting line because mass-start open water swims are carnage. Gives me PTSD just remembering them. Thankfully, this Gran Fondo mass start will be significantly less stressful.

I'm actually most concerned with the descents on Cheaha. There are several kilometers of -6% grades. These should be "fun" as well but I can see them getting out of hand really easily in a group setting since these roads are open to traffic the whole time and we will have people climbing at the same time as people are descending in the other lane. Getting an advantage on the descent by breaking the rules and crossing the center line is just a dangerous dick move but people do it all the time. Coming around a blind corner at high speed even near the center line is a risk for a head on with a car overtaking a climber or even other dick cyclists passing slow climbers in the oncoming lane. I don't care about the podium or my time. I will have to watch out for these assholes the entire ride. I've had to do it before. Descents are the main time that cyclists die, regularly. Even going down and not dying on a descent at my age might permanently stop me from ever being able to ride again. Nothing is worth that risk.



Since the overall time is added to the one 4.6k climbing segment to get the overall points
