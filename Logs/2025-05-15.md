Race week and I definitely have the jitters. I know I shouldn't. I'm prepared and know it will just be fun, but still. It's been a while since any kind of competition for me. I always get weird before a race even if it is just a fun gran fondo primarily for the experience. I used to do the same with triathlons and even simple 10k and 8k road races. Triathlons have the absolute largest amount of stress at the starting line because mass-start open water swims are carnage. Gives me PTSD just remembering them. Thankfully, this Gran Fondo mass start will be significantly less stressful.
