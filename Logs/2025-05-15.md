Race week and I definitely have the jitters. I know I shouldn't. I'm prepared and know it will just be fun, but still. It's been a while since any kind of competition for me. I always get weird before a race even if it is just a fun gran fondo primarily for the experience. I used to do the same with triathlons and even simple 10k and 8k road races. Triathlons have the absolute largest amount of stress at the starting line because mass-start open water swims are carnage. Gives me PTSD just remembering them. Thankfully, this Gran Fondo mass start will be significantly less stressful.

I'm actually most concerned with the descents on Cheaha. There are several kilometers of -6% grades. The should be "fun" as well but I can see them getting out of hand really easily in a group setting. They are not closing the roads so there will always be people crossing the center line even though they should be disqualified for doing so. Getting an advantage on the descent by breaking the rules and crossing the center line is just a dick move but people do it all the time.
