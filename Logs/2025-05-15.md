Race week and I definitely have the jitters. I know I shouldn't. I'm prepared and know it will just be fun, but still. It's been a while since any kind of competition for me. I always get weird before a race even if it is just a fun gran fondo primarily for the experience. I used to do the same with triathlons and even simple 10k and 8k road races. Triathlons have the absolute largest amount of stress at the starting line because mass-start open water swims are carnage. Then there were the days of criterium racing. The blood and broken bones from massive crashes and people with legs sliced open from chain rings. Gives me PTSD just remembering them. Thankfully, this Gran Fondo mass start will be significantly less stressful. Or will it?

I just found out how exceptionally dangerous Cheaha actually is. In fact, after this research I've soured on this event completely [will never do it again](../Cycling/First%20and%20last%20Cheaha%20for%20me.md). It's just a big group training ride with a hill in it at this point. The competitive results are an absolute joke.

I really just want to ride my bike as fast and safely as I can, with friends. My problem is that I am too performance oriented to enjoy adventure cycling and too into the ride over the result to enjoy serious competition. I watched Sy from GCN to Whistler and lament that he missed several tens of miles of the most beautiful scenery in America because he was so focused on the competitive aspect. "Oh well, I guess I can go back and watch the footage." Yeah, that's not me. In fact, all of this has solidly convinced me to ride these events for fun and enjoyment above everything else, to consider them essentially fast-paced group bike tours, not forgettable suffer-fests without taking in any of the scenery. This is the *entire reason* I was attracted to the "timed seg"
