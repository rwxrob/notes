Race week and I definitely have the jitters. I know I shouldn't. I'm prepared and know it will just be fun, but still. It's been a while since any kind of competition for me. I always get weird before a race even if it is just a fun gran fondo primarily for the experience. I used to do the same with triathlons and even simple 10k and 8k road races. Triathlons have the absolute largest amount of stress at the starting line because mass-start open water swims are carnage. Then there were the days of criterium racing. The blood and broken bones from massive crashes and people with legs sliced open from chain rings. Gives me PTSD just remembering them. Thankfully, this Gran Fondo mass start will be significantly less stressful. Or will it?

I just found out how exceptionally dangerous Cheaha actually is. In fact, after this research I've soured on this event completely [will never do it again](../Cycling/First%20and%20last%20Cheaha%20for%20me.md). It's just a big group training ride with a hill in it at this point. The competitive results are an absolute joke.

I really just want to ride my bike as fast and safely as I can, with friends.
