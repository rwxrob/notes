Race week and I definitely have the jitters. I know I shouldn't. I'm prepared and know it will just be fun, but still. It's been a while since any kind of competition for me. I always get weird before a race even if it is just a fun gran fondo primarily for the experience. I used to do the same with triathlons and even simple 10k and 8k road races. Triathlons have the absolute largest amount of stress at the starting line because mass-start open water swims are carnage. Then there were the days of criterium racing. The blood and broken bones from massive crashes and people with legs sliced open from chain rings. Gives me PTSD just remembering them. Thankfully, this Gran Fondo mass start will be significantly less stressful. Or will it?

I just found out how exceptionally dangerous Cheaha actually is. In fact, after this research I've soured on this event completely [will never do it again](../Cycling/First%20and%20last%20Cheaha%20for%20me.md). It's just a big group training ride with a hill in it at this point. The competitive results are an absolute joke.

I really just want to ride my bike as fast and safely as I can, with friends. My problem is that I am too performance oriented to enjoy adventure cycling and too into the ride over the result to enjoy serious competition. I watched Sy from GCN to Whistler and lament that he missed several tens of miles of the most beautiful scenery in America because he was so focused on the competitive aspect. "Oh well, I guess I can go back and watch the footage." Yeah, that's not me. In fact, all of this has solidly convinced me to ride these events for fun and enjoyment above everything else, to consider them essentially fast-paced group bike tours, not forgettable suffer-fests without taking in any of the scenery. This is the *entire reason* I was attracted to the "timed segment" idea of Gran Fondos only to learn that Cheaha organizers have essentially said "fuck that."

Maybe I need to give RAIN and RAGBRAI another look. The NC Mountain to Coast ride will be an interesting comparison as well. The problem is that every time I look at these events I see a bunch of super happy fat people. I know that is horrible to say, but it's the truth. The crowd that gets attracted to these events is so much into having fun that endurance performance and 20 hours a week of training sounds silly to them. I mean, the main photo on the RAGBRAI site right now is a fat guy riding a bull machine. All I can think of is how much risk he's taking on that could destroy all his performance gains for the entire year. Then I remember. He has no performance gains. He's carrying probably 32% body fat.

Where are all the people who are obsessed with endurance training but also completely into the fun aspect? The non-assholes who don't talk stupid shit on group rides and think they are better because their stupid expensive bike hauls their unfit asses around. How do I find them?

I am really hoping I can answer that question this year. DKLEIN and his community seem to have found what I'm looking for but honestly I don't necessarily want to get into gravel just to find those people. There's no way Dustin would grind out miles on a closed loop at 5am in Winter to keep his gains for the coming season. He'd ride indoors on Zwift to maintain "good enough" fitness instead. I want slightly more than that.

I do kind of prefer the bike messenger crowd. They are really my people except for blatantly putting innocent people at risk just to be dicks. Bike messenger values are much more inline with mine. The top messengers are every bit as fit as anyone on the local bike race scene but they don't show it off with a stupid podium. They just know.

Bike messengers would also have no problem biking through a bad part of town. I've been on ad-hoc group rides where the guys riding with me refused to ride on certain lower-income streets even though the tarmac has absolutely pristinely paved recently. Some roadies are the most horrible people I've ever encountered even if I can stand being around them otherwise for a bit of a good ride. Shit like that just seriously limits the amount of potential conversations while riding for several hours.

I've also realized that I do like riding on lonely farm roads every once in a while but I actually crave the urban landscapes and people. The amount of risk is identical to a fast-paced group ride out in farm land on public highways sometimes but the return is so much better.

Maybe it's time for me to look into my fixie obsession again. After I've restored my body composition and health who cares if the quality of my training wanes because I'm riding a fixie through urban streets. I guess we'll see. This year is the year of testing Gran Fondos and getting back into shape. What I do with it after that in 2026 depends on this year but I'm starting to suspect 2026 will actually be the year I return to yoga, paddleboading, Zwift, and urban cycling. I remember I went through this same thing in 2009 when I spend all my time getting really swole in the gym and riding mountain bikes only to move to paddle-boarding and yoga to stay cool and cut in August. At the end of the day it is about fun, and to be completely honest, I'm not thinking Cheaha is going to be fun at all.
