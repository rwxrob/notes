Realizing I just cannot hold that daily schedule, as much as I want to. Being off the bike for a week really smacked the obsession with cycling out of my head as well. It reminded me that—above all—I just want to be healthy, happy, and skinny. Fuck all the competitive part of it, I mean, fuck all of it. If I land on the podium, awesome, but that is no longer a goal, like at all.
