Realizing I just cannot hold that daily schedule, as much as I want to. Being off the bike for a week really smacked the obsession with cycling out of my head as well. It reminded me that—above all—I just want to ride my bike, be healthy, happy, and [skinny](../Cycling/Body%20composition%20first.md). Fuck the competitive part of it, I mean, fuck all of it. If I land on the podium, awesome, but that is no longer a goal, at all. It seems absolutely silly to me now. I am so glad I figured this out.
