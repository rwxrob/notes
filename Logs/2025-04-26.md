Once again, I'm reminded that focusing on performance while still having 17% body fat is kinda stupid. Even though my latest 254 derived FTP from Xert is less than the 270 from before that's fine. For lots of reasons—but mostly vanity—I'm not doing _any_ FTP intensity work until I get down to at least 12%—preferably 10%. This means daily 3-hour endurance rides at zone 2 until I achieve that which might take the entire year. All these Gran Fondos will just be long training rides with other people, no focus on the podium _this year_. Then next year I'll be starting the year at 10% body fat or less and can entirely dial in a plan with varied intensity to get my FTP up to 300 potentially for at least one or two years. Maintaining an FTP of 300 is really hard, and hard on the body. So I will probably shoot to just keep it around 270. I think that's maintainable.

Another group ride. Reminded why I got into triathlon after so many years racing crits as a kid. _Some_ cyclists are the biggest assholes on the planet and for some reason they love to ride in packs. The guy in front on a windy descent was super nice but slow and I kept coasting faster than him. Rather than brake I'd veer off and get a little wind to slow me down. Plus I have the
