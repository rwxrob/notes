Once again, I'm reminded that focusing on performance while still having 17% body fat is kinda stupid. Even though my latest 254 derived FTP from Xert is less than the 270 from before that's fine. For lots of reasons—but mostly vanity—I'm not doing _any_ FTP intensity work until I get down to at least 12%—preferably 10%.
