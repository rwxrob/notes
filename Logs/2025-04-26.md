Once again, I'm reminded that focusing on performance while still having 17% body fat is kinda stupid. Even though my latest 254 derived FTP from Xert is less than the 270 from before that's fine. For lots of reasons—but mostly vanity—I'm not doing _any_ FTP intensity work until I get down to at least 12%—preferably 10%. This means daily 3-hour endurance rides at zone 2 until I achieve that which might take the entire year. All these Gran Fondos will just be long training rides with other people, no focus on the podium _this year_. Then next year I'll be starting the year at 10% body fat or less and can entirely dial in a plan with varied intensity to get my FTP up to 300 potentially for at least one or two years. Maintaining an FTP of 300 is really hard, and hard on the body. So I will probably shoot to just keep it around 270. I think that's maintainable.

Another group ride. Reminded why I got into triathlon after so many years racing crits as a kid. There's always one rider who thinks they are god's gift to cycling who has to run their mouth in ways that aren't just shit talking for fun, who thinks they are absolutely without flaw, the "Karens" (male and female) of the sport. Happily, I made a lot of great new friends with most of the group and had a solid ride even with crosswinds and 65mm deep rims. For what its worth today that rider had zero game and was also that rider who makes excuses to stop for no rational reason. Their attack almost made me laugh, but that would be mean. I had a lot left in the tank because even though I took my share of pulls I don't know the route and would have ended up taking us in the wrong direction, which meant I was very comfortable for most of the ride. In fact, for 80% of the group ride I was barely in active recovery power zone. So I went for another 60k with some hill intervals later. There was one moment when some people attacked and chasing them down was glorious. They burned all their matches so I just kept going after catching them. I said F it. I'll guess the rest of the route home and even though they took a turn that didn't involve a 10% hill like I did I caught at the finish. I was at least four minutes off the front when I made the "wrong" turn (which is the )
