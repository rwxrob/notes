Once again, I'm reminded that focusing on performance while still having 17% body fat is kinda stupid. Even though my latest 254 derived FTP from Xert is less than the 270 from before that's fine. For lots of reasons—but mostly vanity—I'm not doing _any_ FTP intensity work until I get down to at least 12%—preferably 10%. This means daily 3-hour endurance rides at zone 2 until I achieve that which might take the entire year. All these Gran Fondos will just be long training rides with other people, no focus on the podium _this year_. Then next year I'll be starting the year at 10% body fat or less and can entirely dial in a plan with varied intensity to get my FTP up to 300 potentially for at least one or two years. Maintaining an FTP of 300 is really hard, and hard on the body. So I will probably shoot to just keep it around 270. I think that's maintainable.

Another group ride. Reminded why I got into triathlon after so many years racing crits as a kid. There's always one rider who thinks they are god's gift to cycling who has to run their mouth in ways that aren't just shit talking for fun, who believes they are absolutely without flaw, the "Karens" (male and female) of the sport. Happily, I made a lot of great new friends with most of the group and had a solid ride even with crosswinds and 65mm deep rims.

For what its worth today that rider had zero game and was also that rider who makes excuses to stop for no rational reason. Their attack almost made me laugh, but that would be mean. I had a lot left in the tank because, even though I took as many pulls as I confidently could, I don't know the route and would have ended up taking us in the wrong direction, which meant I was very comfortable mid pack for most of the ride.

In fact, for 80% of the group ride I was barely in active recovery power zone. Hardly touched my water or gel. So I went for another 60k with some hill intervals later. 

There was one moment when some people attacked and chasing them down was glorious. We had a chase group even for a while. They burned all their matches so I after I caught them I just kept going. I said F it. I'll guess the rest of the route home and even though they took a turn that didn't involve a 10% hill like I did I caught at the finish. I was at least four minutes off the front when I made the "wrong" turn (which is the same turn we did last week, btw.) As I topped the climb I saw the peloton roar by on the main road so I sprinted to catch them and ended up finishing with them anyway. Had I travelled on the same route I would have finished at least five minutes ahead of all of them. But, like I said, I was dogging like a sprinter unintentionally.

It will be fun to master these routes so I can know when do launch my own attacks next time. I'm going to try the Ocho group next week. We met them last time at the end and it was fun. They are super "spicy" and I'll likely get some more lip from somebody else there. But hey, that's life as a group rider. I can't let it get to me.

At the end of the ride after I had chased and caught and showed I could more than hold my own with this group I tried to explain myself to that person. That's when I realized there is absolutely nothing I can say to this asshole. That's how they are built, to find flaw with everyone around them except themselves (and boy could I offer some "advice" to them). But I should have known that from all the excuses they threw out every time we stopped for these completely unnecessary long rest stops. Moral of the story: keep your Fing mouth shut and ride (unless you have something positive to say.) I'm glad it happened because it reminds me to try and be even better at all of it.

Xert added two points of FTP (256) just from the ride with this new crank today. I love that Xert calculates it on the fly. Got that idea from Dylan Johnson who never does any other FTP test. I've tested at 270 earlier this year but I was starting to doubt that result after my weight training and through it was just the sore legs. I'm realizing now that the test was flawed. Xert seems to be really accurate. I also really love that it tells me exactly how many grams of fat and carb were burned on any given activity. It is so helpful to decide how much carb to carry with me based on the intended effort.

After watching this video from [Dylan Johnson](https://youtu.be/m7BButsq2Rg?si=YDmEFY62HPL6Fpmw) I'm convinced I don't really need the group rides any more. I've been training for years without them and doing just fine. There's just too much drama and risk but—most importantly—it's just bad for fitness development. 

Today's group ride started out with a hammer-fest up the first hill but then became barely hard enough to qualify as active recovery for the next hour or two. A couple guys really wouldn't give up the front so I could pull and frankly I didn't know where we were going. So I was relegated to a super easy draft ride for most of it.

In contrast, usually on Saturdays I do a century at zone 2. Sometimes, if I have the legs, I'll do three hours of zone 2 and _then_ hammer out some hill intervals to improve durability. There's just no doing that in any kind of group ride.

Group rides definitely provide an opportunity to meet cool people who like what you like but that also happens just by riding out there and meeting up on a segment or something for a while. In fact, I sort of like that better. There is a place where serious cyclists just to laps and can talk while doing their training. This is way better.

Then there are the events themselves. These are perfect opportunities to meet and follow people from all over the country, even world. I find this more interesting. While I like meeting the locals, I seriously doubt that any of them would want to go out for a ride and hit the things that I need to.

So good-bye group ride. It was a little fun while it lasted. I'm very content being 200% more fit than everyone on the ride because I never do group rides and waste one of my best weekend training days of the week.
