Sigh. Today's ride was a complete catastrophe. I set out to do 180 and managed to suffer though the last 40k of 100k instead:

- 35C with no heat adaptation
- Lots of sweat so hard to stay hydrated
- Attempt gummy bear carb intake mid ride
- Got sick and tired of hydration drink

A lot of the problem is that I really need to design a nutrition strategy that specifically works for my old body:

- Less muscle mass than the pros
- Only averaging above 200 watts on rides under two hours
- Focused on zone 2 riding, long and slow, mostly
- Sugar sensitivity, perhaps pre-diabetic even though healthy

After thinking a lot about today and doing a ton of research I've made some conclusions:

- Training at my level <250w for less than three hours does not need very much extra carb
- In fact, placing stress on the body by not taking carbs improves performance
- 2025 focus is primarily improving the fat-as-fuel energy pathway
- 2026 I will start seriously gut training for carb-fueled rides
- All rides except Saturday will be pre-fueled eating before and after
- Will continue experimenting with nutrition and gut training for 180km on Saturdays only
- Won't feel bad about bailing if I get anything wrong on Saturdays, I'm discovering things
- Need to mix up training during the week (base2 long rides, 90 minute sweet spot)
- Need to add strength training twice a week
- Added some 60k rides back to [Weekly routine and schedule](../Cycling/Weekly%20routine%20and%20schedule.md)
- Most of a TdF stage the peloton riders are in Zone 1 or 2 only coming out for breakaways and climbs

I also found some amazing recipes:

- [Homemade Gu energy gel recipe](../Cycling/Homemade%20Gu%20energy%20gel%20recipe.md)
- [Homemade UCAN carb drink](../Cycling/Homemade%20UCAN%20carb%20drink.md)
- [Homemade electrolyte powder](../Cycling/Homemade%20electrolyte%20powder.md)

I'm looking forward to testing the gel during my 180k Saturday rides. I feel like Gel can make up the missed sodium if I take the sodium content of my electrolyte drinks down a bit to keep it flavorful. I'm going to try putting ice in my water bottles as well. I used to love that as a younger endurance athlete.

The other carb drink with cornstarch is very intriguing given the origins of UCAN to help people with blood sugar problems. Apparently, it is the simplest complex carb to digest.

And that electrolyte replacement is just genius. No more peeing out unused vitamins in this "recovery" drink powder I have been using. I can get my nutrients from actual food instead. I do like the b12 but I can add that to the gel instead.
