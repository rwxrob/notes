Sigh. Today's ride was a complete catastrophe. I set out to do 180 and managed to suffer though the last 40k of 100k instead:

- 35C with no heat adaptation
- Lots of sweat so hard to stay hydrated
- Attempt gummy bear carb intake mid ride
- Got sick and tired of hydration drink

A lot of the problem is that I really need to design a nutrition strategy that specifically works for my old body:

- Less muscle mass than the pros
- Only averaging above 200 watts on rides under two hours
- Focused on zone 2 riding, long and slow, mostly
- Sugar sensitivity, perhaps pre-diabetic even though healthy

After thinking a lot about today and doing a ton of research I've made some conclusions:

- Training at my level <250w for less than three hours does not need extra carb
- In fact, placing stress on the body by not taking carbs improves
- 2025 focus is primarily improving the fat-as-fuel energy pathway
- 2026 I will start seriously gut training for carb-fueled rides
- Need to mix up training during the week ()
- Need to add strength training twice a week
