Took the day off for recovery and to spend time visiting Gabe with family. Cleaned bike shed. Went grocery shopping for Doris. Discovered the Suarez Gran Fondo National series. I had heard about it before but hadn't really dove into it. Decided to go for it in 2025. First one is Tour of Georgia in two weeks. Thankfully, I'm all trained up and ready. Just have to dial in nutrition a bit.
