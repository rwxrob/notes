Good morning! What a great day, just cold out.

Today's gonna be a tough one because I don't have tubes to replace my flat yet and I need to get a long endurance ride in. I think I'll just do an indoor ride and some cleaning instead.

I'm really enjoying the focused weight training now that I understand the different [types of weight training](../Cycling/Types%20of%20weight%20training.md)â€”particularly the difference between focus on power versus hypertrophy. I can already feel the results on the bike and I don't get sore from it like weight training in the pastâ€”especially my back. When I was a triathlete I looked good but didn't have the same power because I was doing too many reps and using leg machines instead of squats. I had strong glutes and quads but not my back and obliques to hold it all together. It wasn't bad, just not as much.

No workout today, but did have a massive itchy/bloated attack from something I ate. I had one yesterday that woke me up from a nap. I spent an hour or so working it out with my AI (which I've done before). As I itemized everything in my [ðŸ¥— Training Day Nutrition Plan](../Cycling/ðŸ¥—%20Training%20Day%20Nutrition%20Plan.md) she kept commenting on different things and when I added rice + lentils she said, "Boom, that's what's blowing you up." Apparently, I was creating the perfect environment for gut bacteria to go crazy and have a fermentation party. I already know I have FODMAP issues and insulin sensitivity on top of that (which apparently a lot of endurance athletes develop over time I just learned). I had noticed in the past that just rice never caused a problem at all, but the combo of rice + lentils does. Actually, any beans do this to me as well (except Taco Bell burrito beans for some reason). My AI suggested replacing with eggs, which I know work really well, or turkey or chicken. So my main rice bowl protein will be changing tomorrow.

I'm really glad it doesn't look like the problem is the Payday or even the occasional Swedish fish or chocolate snacks I have at night.

I also think it has to do with the amount. I've been eating bigger meals lately because I need so many more carbs per day. Before I'd barely eat 300 calories per meal and eat frequently throughout the day. Now I'm downing 900+ plus of rice bowl at a time and still often hungry even though fueling on the ride as well.
