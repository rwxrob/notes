Fully recovered. I hate to change the flat before my ride later so leaving a bit earlier.

Ride was amazing. Absolutely perfect weather. Just a few observations:

- Need to remove as much of Shearer Road from my route between Greystone and Rocky River as possible. With 80psi in the tires it's murder at anything about 25kph. Also, that section tends to have more traffic and less shoulder.
- 60 km is not enough. I finished that in about two hours. I need to add another 10-20 km to the regular base route so that I'm riding for 2.5-3 hours.
- Absolutely zero need to fuel on entire ride. Did just barely have enough water though. I think I drank too much at the start because ended up peeing after the ride.
- 2.5 hours of zone 2 was only 90 TSS. I'm going to need to either add more riding, perhaps even on strength days, up the intensity on one or more, or really make sure I'm doing 180-200 on the weekend long ride. I'll probably do that latter because it trains all the performance while fatigued stuff.
- Used Trek Carback and it is so superior to Garmin Varia it's ridiculous. It has app that vibrates or makes my phone make a noise (which I can hear because I'm wearing bone-conducting headphones). It actually shoes long vehicles on the radar. It has an "all clear" sound and turns the Garmin green, which the Varia does not do. It uses USB C for charging (the reason I looked at it). It has a perfect attachment for the seat putting the light higher in the same position as you would see on a motorcycle.
