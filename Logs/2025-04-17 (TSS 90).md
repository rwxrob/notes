Fully recovered this cold morning. I hate to change the flat before my ride later so leaving a bit earlier.

Ride was amazing. Absolutely perfect weather. Just a few observations:

- Need to remove as much of Shearer Road from my route between Greystone and Rocky River as possible. With 80psi in the tires it's murder at anything about 25kph. Also, that section tends to have more traffic and less shoulder.
- 60 km is not enough. I finished that in about two hours. I need to add another 10-20 km to the regular base route so that I'm riding for 2.5-3 hours.
- Absolutely zero need to fuel on entire ride. Did just barely have enough water though. I think I drank too much at the start because ended up peeing after the ride.
- 2.5 hours of zone 2 was only 90 TSS. I'm going to need to either add more riding, perhaps even on strength days, or up the intensity
