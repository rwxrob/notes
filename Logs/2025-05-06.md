 Tired sleeping in the car last night but it got down to 4 degrees C and I definitely don't have the clothes for that. That's what I get for packing for a northern Idaho trip just after a warm, muggy average NC day. The two McDoubles that I had nearly killed me. I swear. My entire system is still trying to recover from eating them. I ended up getting a cheap Super8 hotel room for two nights. I'll stock it up with hard-boiled eggs from the grocery store. The free breakfast is just a bunch of different variations on sugar. This morning I can already tell my body is revolting because it didn't get to play yesterday. It's super confused by the altitude altitude changes which is good to know in case I ever to a Gran Fondo here. Coming in a day or even a week to acclimate a minimal amount will make the event more possible. I'm seriously thinking of doing Gran Fondo Logan next year since my daughter lives here. Plus I just love Logan for some reason. Lived in Utah most of my life and never realized what a great region the Cache Valley actually is. In fact, for fun, I think I will drive the entire course for the Logan Gran Fondo today just to kill some time waiting for my family to be available.

On second thought, maybe I won't drive the Cache Gran Fondo course. After reading all about it I have no intention of ever riding it:

- Directly conflicts with Gran Fondo Asheville
- Requires expense and hassle of flying and crating bike
- Wonky points system for 105 mile course
- Mid July is hottest part of Utah summer
- Tons of goat-head thorns meaning flats are likely
- Elevation and low humidity inconsistent with training weather
- Downright ugly scenery compared to pretty much every other qualifying event

I was thinking it could be an opportunity to see family but the conflict with Gran Fondo Asheville is an immediate *no way*. I absolutely love Asheville event and know that they need the support after the hurricane. Plus Asheville is Doris' and my "mother ship" where we had our anniversary. The rest of the reasons just really make it obvious.

The more I look at my collection of [annual bike events](../Fitness/Annual%20bike%20events.md) the more I think I pretty much nailed it.
