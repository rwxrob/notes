Reminded this morning that I'm training for my health and friendships, not competition, except against myself.

Revised and simplified my [strength training routine](../Fitness/Strength%20training%20(mon,%20thu).md).

Decided with a sedentary job I really cannot miss the two-hour bike rides every day. I don't even hit the minimum levels of activity needed for basic health if I don't. This includes days on which I also do strength training.

After a lot of serious reflection, I've decided not to personally mentor anyone who has not been vetted. I don't want to train the equivalent of the next pilot who will fly a plan into a building with their new skills. Giving random people on the Internet the power and skills I've learned over a very long time comes with some level of personal accountability and responsibility.

I've decided that, although I will keep my tech content up and available on YouTube, that I am going to entirely rebrand rwxrob as an active senior lifestyle, fitness, and adventure channel, which is also the main focus of my life these days going into retirement.
