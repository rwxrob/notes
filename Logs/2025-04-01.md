[Simple is underrated](../Philosophy/Simple%20is%20underrated.md) is almost an understatement. I'm seeing more evidence of this in my life now than every before. God I wish I had really internalized this lesson earlier.

I've moved to just general logging, sometimes it will be about cycling, sometimes it won't. It's not really a "blog" even though it's a log of stuff and it's available on the Web.

I enjoy thinking and writing more than talking to other people. It's been fun to rediscover that about myself. I do an amazing amount of thinking while riding for 2-3 hours a day. Some of it gets written down, most not. 

I write because I like writing. I also feel like people who actually care to know my thoughts have the option to read them if they truly want to do. It's not like those mentally ill people who's "love language" is forcing them to read through their writing to prove they actually love them. "If you love me you'd read what I have written" is a very fucked up idea. That's not how love works, at all.
