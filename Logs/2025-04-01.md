[Simple is underrated](../Philosophy/Simple%20is%20underrated.md) is almost an understatement. I'm seeing more evidence of this in my life now than every before. God I wish I had really internalized this lesson earlier.

I've moved to just general logging, sometimes it will be about cycling, sometimes it won't. It's not really a "blog" even though it's a log of stuff and it's available on the Web.

I enjoy thinking and writing more than talking to other people. It's been fun to rediscover that about myself. I do an amazing amount of thinking while riding for 2-3 hours a day. Some of it gets written down, most not. I write because I like writing.

I also feel like people who actually care to know my thoughts have the option to read them if they truly want to. Lazy people who need a notification to see me answer their questions for the 100th time while ADHDing themselves to death switching between Twitch channels are simply not people on whom I wish to expend my limited energy. I'm starting to think Darwin was right about human behavior more than most care to admit. The "fittest" actually do the work to improve themselves. The rest languish and die. That's not on me. That's nature. I'm done rewarding the lazy.
