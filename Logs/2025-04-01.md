[Simple is underrated](../Philosophy/Simple%20is%20underrated.md) is almost an understatement. I'm seeing more evidence of this in my life now than every before. God I wish I had really internalized this lesson earlier.

I've moved to just general logging, sometimes it will be about cycling, sometimes it won't. It's not really a "blog" even though it's a log of stuff and it's available on the Web.

I enjoy thinking and writing more than talking to other people. It's been fun to rediscover that about myself. I do an amazing amount of thinking while riding for 2-3 hours a day. Some of it gets written down, most not. 

I write because I like writing. I also feel like people who actually care to know my thoughts have the option to read them if they truly want to do. It's not like those mentally ill people who's "love language" is forcing them to read through their writing to prove they actually love them. "If you love me you'd read what I have written" is a very fucked up idea. That's not how love works, at all.

By the way, murdering a drunk king by decapitating him with his own sword just so some people will have "the brass plates" so they don't "dwindle and perish in unbelief" is even _more_ fucked up. That's in the first two pages of the Book of Mormon. The idea that God needs to have a follower murder someone and that the upcoming nation will lose their way without some physical copy of what a bunch of people wrote hundred of years before them is also absolutely completely fucked up. If I had no other evidence that Mormons—and the whole of the Abrahamic religions if you include the story of Abraham and his son—are absolute evil frauds responsible for countless genocides that's all I would need. You have to be a particularly dangerous level of stupid to believe any of that.

Today's ride was beautiful. No matter how many times I ride Goblin Medio I find something new to see. This year I've noticed the exact sequence of when certain trees bloom. Dogwoods have been blooming for about a week now, almost exactly around Easter, which is probably why they are revered so much by Christians (along with their four leafs in a cross).

I'm starting to think shifting to 40k (2 hours) during the week will work out better logistically all around. Then I could eventually do two back-back 180k rides on Saturday and Sunday with a 40k super slow recovery on Monday. In fact, that might be more like the type of endurance training I need.

I could even turn 2x112 into a fun fast-pace bikepacking thing later so that I can do out and backs to interesting places. 100 miles is a pretty good range to get to some interesting things. If I stayed in a hotel, travelled only during really reliable, good weather, and ate at restaurants I wouldn't have to carry anything but pretty much the clothes on my back, a windbreaker, toe covers, and an ultralight shirt and overshorts and sandals for off the bike.
