[Simple is underrated](../Philosophy/Simple%20is%20underrated.md) is almost an understatement. I'm seeing more evidence of this in my life now than every before. God I wish I had really internalized this lesson earlier.

I've moved to just general logging, sometimes it will be about cycling, sometimes it won't. It's not really a "blog" even though it's a log of stuff and it's available on the Web.

I enjoy thinking and writing more than talking to other people. It's been fun to rediscover that about myself.
