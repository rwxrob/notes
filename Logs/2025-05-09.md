Yeah yesterday was really exhausting on so many levels. Just the drinking tanked me this morning. There is absolutely no way I could do even minimal training at the hotel today. I actually will have to schedule a recovery nap just to recover from the damage that day did to my body all by itself. I don't regret it but I have definitely committed to never drinking alcohol for pretty much anything except the most extraneous social exceptions.

I am really looking foreward to [joining a team](../Fitness/Should%20I%20join%20a%20team.md) next year. Hopefully that would mean riding meaningfully in group rides without the broken, unexpected dynamics.
