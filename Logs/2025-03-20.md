Today I plan on getting out on Goblin for a recovery ride while it is still warm. Yesterday really kicked my ass (or was it actually the day before that did and yesterday was just the result of not proper recovery the day after that). Should take about three hours.
## Kit

- New grey ClubRide Go-Long, sleeves down (now I have both of them)
- Black sleeveless wicking undershirt (kept the chill off, and nipples from getting raw from bib straps)
- Breaking in new NeoPro black cargo bibs (still feeling a little too tight)
- MAAP Evade cap (so glad I did, saved me from hypothermia I swear)
- 2023 Specialized Torch 3 road shoes
- Perl Izumi merino wool mid-length socks
- Adidas glasses with polarizing lenses
## Report

| Distance | Elevation | Time    | NPower | TSS | Route        | Temp   | Wind   | Weather |
| -------- | --------- | ------- | ------ | --- | ------------ | ------ | ------ | ------- |
| 61.35    | 631       | 2:58:06 | 134    | 100 | Goblin Medio | 25-13C | 30 kph | Cloudy  |

Ride started at 25C and dropped to 13 by the end with 30kph winds _on average_. It was brutal. I started in thermal tights and went back and changed to bibs because they were too hot. Boy did I regret that. Here's what I learned:

- 2 550 ml water bottles with two scoops electrolyte each was perfect
- Only ate about a dozen gummies total for the ride and was strong whole way
- Sips were a bit too big every 15 minutes making me want to pee before the end
- Winds blew me around like a leaf making me rethink deep rim aero wheels
- Putting off high-end deep rim wheels until at least 2026
- Realized I really do need to get into the gym to up my power
- Saw a Strava dude pushing 250 for two hours and only getting 45 TSS (that would kill me)
- Go-Long doubled sleeve layer on top of arms is completely brilliant!
