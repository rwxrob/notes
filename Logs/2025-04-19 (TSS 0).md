Going to try a casual group ride this morning. My Whoop tells me to take it easy today after a 19.1 stress score yesterday.

I think I'm going to start wearing the HR monitor again to show my HR drift more accurately while I'm training. That will hopefully help me be sure that the FTP power stuff is honest. I see now why Tadej Pogačar actually prefers a heart rate monitor but uses it in combination with power numbers. Checking my HR keeps me honest when looking at the other stuff and so much can go wrong with the power meter while very little can go wrong with a chest strap heart rate monitor. I know that because I knocked mine and didn't recalibrate. People say you are supposed to recalibrate power meters every ride but that is just not happening. Maybe once a week.

Today I learned that I actually have 50/34 chain rings. I think I want to switch my front big chain ring to a 54—especially after moving to 160mm cranks (from 172.5 that I have stock). I rode yesterday in nothing but the big ring for the entire three hours and I spun out way too much on yesterday's ride. I figure the small ring is only for really long steep hills but I don't drop below 72 cadence even in the 52. I'm not completely decided yet. When my power and weight training gains come I definitely will need to.
