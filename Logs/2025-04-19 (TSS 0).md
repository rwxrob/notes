Going to try a casual group ride this morning. My Whoop tells me to take it easy today after a 19.1 stress score yesterday.

I think I'm going to start wearing the HR monitor again to show my HR drift more accurately while I'm training. That will hopefully help me be sure that the FTP power stuff is honest. I see now why Tadej Pogačar actually prefers a heart rate monitor but uses it in combination with power numbers. Checking my HR keeps me honest when looking at the other stuff and so much can go wrong with the power meter while very little can go wrong with a chest strap heart rate monitor. I know that because I knocked mine and didn't recalibrate. People say you are supposed to recalibrate power meters every ride but that is just not happening. Maybe once a week.

Today I learned that I actually have 50/34 chain rings. I think I want to switch my front big chain ring to a 52 or 54—especially after moving to 160mm cranks (from 172.5 that I have stock). I rode yesterday in nothing but the big ring for the entire three hours and I spun out way too much on yesterday's ride. I figure the small ring is only for really long steep hills but I don't drop below 72 cadence even in the 52. I'm not completely decided yet. When my power and weight training gains come I definitely will need to.

Met Cole and Carlos on 50 mile Spirited Cycling ride today. Just the three of us at first (apparently no one besides us was up for a long ride, which made me super happy to have been training since January). We met with a much larger group to do the bad stuff at the end, which was nice.  I went to the group ride to practice my peloton skills and get them back into habits and I certainly got that. I learned later that there was some attacking and chasing happening in the 30 mile group ride, which is awesome. I will forward to that eventually. For now, however, I only want to do that kind of internal competing against other people with the same durability who can still attack and chase after 40 or even 80 miles of riding. Attacks on 30 mile rides are a totally different dynamic that play to people's
