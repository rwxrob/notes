Going to try a casual group ride this morning. My Whoop tells me to take it easy today after a 19.1 stress score yesterday.

I think I'm going to start wearing the HR monitor again to show my HR drift more accurately while I'm training. That will hopefully help me be sure that the FTP power stuff is honest. I see now why Tadej Pogačar actually prefers a heart rate monitor but uses it in combination with power numbers. Checking my HR keeps me honest when looking at the other stuff and so much can go wrong with the power meter while very little can go wrong with a chest strap heart rate monitor. I know that because I knocked mine and didn't recalibrate. People say you are supposed to recalibrate power meters every ride but that is just not happening. Maybe once a week.

Today I learned that I actually have 50/34 chain rings. I think I want to switch my front big chain ring to a 52 or 54—especially after moving to 160mm cranks (from 172.5 that I have stock). I rode yesterday in nothing but the big ring for the entire three hours and I spun out way too much on yesterday's ride. I figure the small ring is only for really long steep hills but I don't drop below 72 cadence even in the 52. I'm not completely decided yet. When my power and weight training gains come I definitely will need to.

Met Cole and Carlos on 50 mile Spirited Cycling ride today. Just the three of us at first (apparently no one besides us was up for a long ride, which made me super happy to have been training since January). We met with a much larger group to do the bad stuff at the end, which was nice. 

I went to the group ride to practice my peloton skills and get them back into habits and I certainly got that.

I learned later that there was some attacking and chasing happening in the 30 mile group ride, which is awesome. I look forward to that eventually but honestly, I have no interest in competing against other people who don't have the same durability and volume that I do, who can still attack and chase after 40 or even 80 miles of riding. Attacks on 30 mile rides are a totally different dynamic that play to the advantages of people with higher FTP but who have crappy durability. They have no staying power. Usually they also have the most expensive bikes and kit, by the way. They also tend to have the biggest (unearned) egos. So always picking the long ride group is definitely going to filter out the people will personalities and values that I share, which certainly worked with Cole and Carlos, two amazing dudes. 

I was a little self-conscious about wearing dad glasses and I still having some padding around the middle. I sort of have a disguise. No one would look at me and say "there's a certified weapon" but I _am_ a certified weapon as longer distances.

We really ended up pushing hard the last 20k or so because of the new group, which was fun and fine. Ironically, I ended up doing 82k when I did 70+k both yesterday and the day before, and at tempo. I was expecting to be really fatigued and unable to keep up but seriously surprised myself. In fact, when I got to the bike shed I changed my mind and turned around to do another 80 and get a century in because I felt so good and the day was so nice. It was not what I was expecting. I think the energy of the group really helped. I'm looking forward to the next one.

Had to take the bike in to the shop. I have enough things to have done that it makes sense to just pay for it:

- 160mm cranks
- Mount for Trek Carback
- Silence rattling in brake levers (turns out screw I couldn't find not tightened enough)
- Fix gears which no longer shift into lowest (turns out also frayed and installed poorly)
- Repair rear flat
- Convert both front and back to tubeless

After my second flat in three days I'm starting to suspect that the speed and roads here are the issue. I have a feeling I'm getting snake-bite flats even when they aren't really detectable. I find that I really cannot mess around with 26/28cc tires because there is very little margin of error. I'm hoping tubeless will help with running lower pressures even in those but feel like I might be looking at putting 30cc tires on their instead eventually.
