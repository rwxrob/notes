Going to try a casual group ride this morning. My Whoop tells me to take it easy today after a 19.1 stress score yesterday.

I think I'm going to start wearing the HR monitor again to show my HR drift more accurately while I'm training. That will hopefully help me be sure that the FTP power stuff is honest. I see now why Tadej Pogačar actually prefers a heart rate monitor but uses it in combination with power numbers. Checking my HR keeps me honest when looking at the other stuff and so much can go wrong with the power meter while very little can go wrong with a chest strap heart rate monitor. I know that because I knocked mine and didn't recalibrate. People say you are supposed to recalibrate power meters every ride but that is just not happening. Maybe once a week.

Today I learned that I actually have 50/34 chain rings. I think I want to switch my front big chain ring to a 52 or 54—especially after moving to 160mm cranks (from 172.5 that I have stock). I rode yesterday in nothing but the big ring for the entire three hours and I spun out way too much on yesterday's ride. I figure the small ring is only for really long steep hills but I don't drop below 72 cadence even in the 52. I'm not completely decided yet. When my power and weight training gains come I definitely will need to.

Met Cole and Carlos on 50 mile Spirited Cycling ride today. Just the three of us at first (apparently no one besides us was up for a long ride, which made me super happy to have been training since January). We met with a much larger group to do the bad stuff at the end, which was nice. 

I went to the group ride to practice my peloton skills and get them back into habits and I certainly got that.

I learned later that there was some attacking and chasing happening in the 30 mile group ride, which is awesome. I look forward to that eventually but honestly, I have no interest in competing against other people who don't have the same durability and volume that I do, who can still attack and chase after 40 or even 80 miles of riding. Attacks on 30 mile rides are a totally different dynamic that play to the advantages of people with higher FTP but who have crappy durability. They have no staying power. Usually they also have the most expensive bikes and kit, by the way. They also tend to have the biggest (unearned) egos. So always picking the long ride group is definitely going to filter out the posers and assholes. I might look like a dad on a bike to them, but Strava doesn't lie.

We really ended up pushing hard the last 20k or so because of the new group, which was fun and fine. 

I get the sense over the years that I did that as well when I raced crits as a kid. I could be wrong, but adding 50 miles to any group ride and _then_ having fun in the last 10 or 20 really equalizes things out. The only people who can hang for that long and still be competitive are the people putting in the volume I do and, frankly, no one at this group ride has topped by volume. (I've been top five, 1st for a while, on the Strava comparison of volume and longest ride.) If I was competing against me, and these group rides were compared to stages, then going on the longer stages with opportunities to attack near the end would be the ones I would watch out for me on.
