Strong endurance ride today even though the route I threw together was really sketch. Major traffic hardly phases me at this point, which is probably bad. I just keep the music playing and have the noise reduction ear plugs in so that loudness doesn't freak me out and blow my HR off the chart with stress. In short, I'm a lot more chill and dialed-in on the bike.

- Upped seat 150mm
- Dropped pressure to 59/61
- Upped protein to 160g per day
- Turned up carbs to 60g per hour on bike
- Turned down carbs almost completely off bike
- Weight up by 500g but fat mass down to 16% from 19%

I'm still embarrassingly jiggly compared to my peak but getting there. I long for the days when the vein in my lower oblique ab was the measurement of where my fat percentage was. When it stopped popping I knew it was time to cut again. Silly, I know.

It is so strange to be in such amazingly great shape and yet still flabby. Just goes to show that fat is not the measure of fitness. I had a rather overweight friend in my 30s who would do 2+ hour marathons. You just don't know. Still, for me W/kg is so freaking important on those timed-segment climbs that I really need to lose it. I'm focusing on eating mostly protein and some fat for my daily calories off the bike. It seems to be working.

I  decided to capture my [long term cycling goals](../Fitness/Long%20term%20cycling%20goals.md). They don't *specifically* require my be competitive or place at a certain level but it would be so much fun to have a GFNats jersey. I absolutely understand that the secret to joy is not focusing on a particular outcome but if that turns out to be the outcome of putting 10,000+ hours into my cycling it will just be really nice to have.
