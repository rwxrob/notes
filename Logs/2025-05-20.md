Strong endurance ride today even though the route I threw together was really sketch. Major traffic hardly phases me at this point, which is probably bad. I just keep the music playing and have the noise reduction ear plugs in so that loudness doesn't freak me out and blow my HR off the chart with stress levels. In short, I'm a lot more chill and dialed-in on the bike. Upped seat 150mm and dropped pressure to 59/61. Crazy thing is I'm turning in higher power and speeds without changing anything else. So weird but checks out.

- Upped my protein to 160g per day
- Turned up carbs to 60g per hour on bike
- Turned down carbs almost completely off bike
- Weight up 500g but fat mass down to 16% from 19%

I'm still embarrassingly jiggly compared to my peak but getting there. I long for the days when the vein in my lower oblique ab was the measurement of where my fat percentage was. When it stopped popping I knew it was time to cut again. Silly, I know. It is so strange to be in such amazingly great shape and yet still flabby. Just goes to show that fat is not the measure of fitness. I had a rather overweight friend in my 30s who would do 3 hour marathons. You just don't know. Still, for me W/kg is so freaking important on those timed-segment climbs that I really need to lose it.
