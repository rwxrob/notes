Put together [Monthly food plan](../Fitness/Monthly%20food%20plan.md) since I had to resubscribe to Huel. Being an endurance athlete makes eating into a secondary hobby for sure, and it can get expensive. I never understand people who waste money on "performance nutrition" things like gels and chews and drinks that are 10 times the cost of light corn syrup and a caffeine pill. Thankfully there are a lot of very cheap, good carb sources out there. I do think discovering Huel instead of a multi-vitamin was a huge find. I feel like the nutrients aren't being peed out like multi-vitamins. Also, now that I'm up to 4 scoops per 2-3 hour ride of electrolyte powder I feel like I'm really nailing some micronutrient and mineral deficiencies I had in my training before.

Wife and I had a great coffee talk discussion about the _true_ expense of eating well and prioritizing resources on health and wellness. I always look at expensive unused homes, RVs, boats and think about how wasteful they are compared to the cost of even the higher end of the low-end cycling stuff I have acquired, my monthly food, and the tools that I use to maintain my own bikes that I use for 2-3 hours every single day without costing me a dime in travel costs to ward off chronic, debilitating diseases that bankrupt people within a year. My wife is like, "It's too expensive _not_ to eat good food and stay active." 

***The problem in America is the perception that good food, exercise, and active clothing is "too expensive" when the overall long-term cost of consuming crappy alternatives is 100s if not 1000s of times more expensive.***

Consider just one year of diabetes medication. America has a type 2 diabetes epidemic currently. Insulin is $6000 per year. Other medications like Ozempic (which has skyrocketed in cost as a diet drug) is $10,000 per year. There's no way even great insurance is covering all of that so the average person pays at least $6000 annual just on their disease they could have completely prevented by living a healthier life that included _buying a brand new bike every single year_ instead.

People who get type 2 diabetes rarely beat it, meaning that if they get it in their mid 40s they are going to be spending 100s of thousands of dollars on something that was completely preventable by investing a tiny fraction of that cost up font on good stuff to actually maintain health. Many will lose limbs making physical activity even harder. These same people will go into massive debt for completely stupid things like fancy trips, sporting events, movies, eating out, and expensive recreational vehicles that they barely use from which they sip gallons of high-fructose soft drinksâ€”or worseâ€”diet drinks.

So yeah, my outdoor active gear and cycling stuff _is cheap_ in comparison to what _most_ Americans end up spending without even realizing it, but all these people see is an "expensive bike" or "fancy food."

And how can you put the price on an extra yearâ€”or tenâ€”of life? Staying active doing something you absolutely love outdoors and eating the best, homemade food you can with your family is scientifically proven to add decades to lifespan. People simple cannot afford _not_ to spend resources on these important things but they don't.

Then there's _quality_ of life. When I was suffering from chronic inflammation (a relatively minor thing compared to other maladies) I was miserable every single day. Now every day is filled with absolute joy no matter how dark the weather or state of the world. My entire outlook on life is better, happier, and I'm doing so much more for those around me. I'm a much better human being. I cannot help wonder what if _everyone_ lived a life dedicated to similar priorities. One thing is for sure, there would be far less whining, complaining, and self-identifying with one's physical ailments instead of their personality, activities, and relationships. All those good 'ol boy truck drivers proud of their massive beer bellies ain't got no fucking clue how miserable they _will_ be very soon.

I won't even get into how much I _personally_â€”as a member of this societyâ€”have to pay for all the people who _don't_ address these issues. This is one main reason I never want to be that type of drag on society. It's like second hand smoke but good luck trying to tell these slobs with no intention of ever getting off their fat asses that their choices are actually hurting anyone but themselves. This is one time I wish I could force them all into the military for basic training where they don't mess around (disclosure: I would never have made it). I'll get accused of "body shaming" or worse. 

A world where everyone actually cares enough about their body and health to treat them with respect is not the reality we live in. All I can do is focus on making myself into what I want to be. I have zero hate for anyone else. The more I just get out there the more this love and concern simply increases, that's all. Being healthy is a *personal* choice that everyone has to face in their own way and time. I've just been reminded of mine.

After that ride I looked into TSS again for pros. I'm no pro but lately I tend to have pro volume tolerances and recovery levels mostly because of my work-from-bed job, consistent refueling routine, great sleep, and snuggling on the couch with my wife every night. ðŸ¤£

I can easily recover from a 170 TSS day, possibly even 200, which is what I read that pro riders probably do. If you add up their 120-180 daily average over the course of an entire year, meaning if they have 0 TSS on the off days their ride days they must hover around 200.

That makes a lot more sense to me now. I need to understand my TSS perfectly because, honestly, today felt _easy_. I need to know how much more I can push on sweet spot days. This also explains why I felt I left some in the tank after last weekends century. In fact, a 3-hour sweet spot ride comes in at 200 TSS as does 5+ hours of zone 2. I feel like I can push up to 200 TSS for my daily 2.5 hour ride. I like thinking in terms of TSS instead of power or speed or time.

- Felt strangely warmer than temperature, more like 24C, probably humidity
- Working out that 180-190 must be my 75% (240-ish FTP or higher)
- Holding 180 for 2.5 hours even with 220 long climbs and 300+ hill attacks felt really easy
- Definitely gained 10 watts after seat adjust a few days ago, perfectly dialed in now
