No training today or for a while. Wife and step-son moved out today, permanently. So much for getting rides back from Asheville, or anywhere. I'm on my own, again. Emotional stress (goes without saying) is sky high and I have frequent, intense migraine headaches. We'll see if my body even recovers from this for months at this point. Saw some 65k rider fly by me while waiting for my family to move out parked in Davidson. He looked great and strong but all I saw was the futility of my existence in him. Having a hard time thinking my life matters, like, at all at this point. Chasing podiums or even Strava segments feels stupid, small, and trivial. Riding my bike was saving my marriage until it couldn't any more. On the plus side, I care a whole lot less about dying instantly in traffic.
