No training today or for a while. Wife and step-son moved out today, permanently. So much for getting rides back from Asheville, or anywhere. I'm on my own, again. Emotional stress (goes without saying) is sky high and I have frequent, intense migraine headaches. We'll see if my body can recover from this after a full months at this point. Asheville just reminds me of her and our anniversary. So much for that. I'll do it anyway but with an entirely different reason at this point. Probably will dehydrate from crying on the ride the whole time.

Saw some 65 kilo rider fly by me parked in Davidson while waiting for my family to move out. He looked great and strong but all I saw was the futility of my existence in him. Having a hard time thinking my life matters at all at this point. Riding a bike is not a life. Chasing podiums or even Strava segments feels stupid, small, trivial. Riding was saving my marriage until it couldn't any more, just like my first failed marriage.

On the plus side, I care a whole lot less about dying instantly in traffic.
