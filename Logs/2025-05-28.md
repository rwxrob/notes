Yesterday I went down the adventure cycling rabbit hole that always sucks away my life. It starts with an obsession with crossing the country by bike. It's been a dream of mine since I was a kid. I just think it's cool, probably for all the wrong reasons that I won't learn until I do it. Here's the reality check:

- Any trip across the country worth doing would take about 40 days
- I will never have 40 days off of work, period
- The expense of such a trip would easily be in the $5000 range when using hotels/campsites
- Crossing the country by bike is seriously bad for your long-term health
- I don't need to cross the country to get adventure
- Doris can be waiting for me on local adventures
