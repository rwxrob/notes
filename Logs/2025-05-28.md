Yesterday I went down the adventure cycling rabbit hole that always sucks away my life. It starts with an obsession with crossing the country by bike. It's been a dream of mine since I was a kid. I just think it's cool, probably for all the wrong reasons that I won't learn until I do it. Here's the reality check:

- Any trip across the country worth doing would take about 40 days
- I will never have 40 days off of work, period (until I retire)
- I prefer a fast but comfortable bike over a durable bike with tons of gear
- The expense of such a trip would easily be in the $5000 range when using hotels/campsites
- Crossing the country by bike is seriously bad for your long-term health
- I don't need to cross the country to get adventure
- Doris can be waiting for me on local adventures

I am, however, faced with the decision to change the default configuration of my main bike, my Trek Domane. The reality is that I spend 99% of my time on that bike by myself out there training and having fun. The entire reason I started thinking about [performance adventure cycling](../Fitness/Performance%20adventure%20cycling%20FTW.md) again was because I'm getting bored of the 4-hour options every day and it's starting to rain a lot more and I don't want to go out as much when it does mostly because my bike isn't setup for it. If my default bike setup is compatible with a PAC focus I can train on it—without alteration—all year long and go anywhere that I want with relatively little extra effort including most gravel roads. If I leave on my default Tailfin Aero Cargo bag I'm ready for minimal local adventures any time I want—including trips to the store for beer or whatever.

Converting my default bike into a PAC bike means [gravel over road shoes](../Fitness/Gravel%20over%20road%20shoes.md) and fat [50-50 all-road tires](../Fitness/Best%2050-50%20all-road%20tire.md) with white walls and a [TailFin Aeropack Cargo](https://www.tailfin.cc/product/rear-systems/aeropacks/aeropack/) rack. Hell, I might as well put on the aero bars as well to make up all the speed I will lose from that pack and heavier wheels. At that point most roadies won't even wave to me let alone take me seriously. Do I care? Unfortunately, yes, I hate admitting it, but I do actually care. My Strava times will all be a lot slower without really any explanation as to why. I suppose I can shut all that up with massive volume. Even roadies appreciate ultra-endurance volume and milage. When I start posting double centuries in a single day every weekend to Asheville and the coast there won't be any way *not* to know why my bike looks like that. Then when I start posting Strava segments of me crossing the fucking country, well, any cred I narcissistically care about will be satisfied.

The extra weight of the gear I'll be carrying will quickly be offset by my body weight shrinking to 67 kilos because I'll be able to comfortably increase the volume to insane levels. Most importantly, with this setup as my default I will easily be able to ride all year long in North Carolina and *want* to do so in order to train for the rough conditions of a BNSUS if I ever did one. 

Even though I don't think I'll be able to do a BNSUS I want to be *ready* to do one when and if the time comes. In fact, this is now my [long term cycling goals](../Fitness/Long%20term%20cycling%20goals.md) even if I for other reasons I never get to take that time off and attempt it. I can let that imagery power me through all the local training I am doing now.
