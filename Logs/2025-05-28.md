Yesterday I went down the adventure cycling rabbit hole that always sucks away my life. It starts with an obsession with crossing the country by bike. It's been a dream of mine since I was a kid. I just think it's cool, probably for all the wrong reasons that I won't learn until I do it. Here's the reality check:

- Any trip across the country worth doing would take about 40 days
- I will never have 40 days off of work, period
- I prefer a fast but comfortable bike over a durable bike with tons of gear
- The expense of such a trip would easily be in the $5000 range when using hotels/campsites
- Crossing the country by bike is seriously bad for your long-term health
- I don't need to cross the country to get adventure
- Doris can be waiting for me on local adventures

I am, however, faced with the decision to change the default configuration of my main bike, my Trek Domane. The reality is that I spend 99% of my time on that bike by myself out there training and having fun. The entire reason I started thinking about [performance adventure cycling](../Fitness/Performance%20adventure%20cycling%20FTW.md) again was because I'm getting bored of the 4-hour options every day and it's starting to rain a lot more and I don't want to go out as much when it does mostly because my bike isn't setup for it. If my default bike setup is compatible with a PAC focus I can train on it—without alteration—all year long and go anywhere
