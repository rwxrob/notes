Yesterday I went down the adventure cycling rabbit hole that always sucks away my life. It starts with an obsession with crossing the country by bike. It's been a dream of mine since I was a kid. I just think it's cool, probably for all the wrong reasons that I won't learn until I do it. Here's the reality check:

- Any trip across the country worth doing would take about 40 days
- I will never have 40 days off of work, period (until I retire)
- I prefer a fast but comfortable bike over a durable bike with tons of gear
- The expense of such a trip would easily be in the $5000 range when using hotels/campsites
- Crossing the country by bike is seriously bad for your long-term health
- I don't need to cross the country to get adventure
- Doris can be waiting for me on local adventures

I am, however, faced with the decision to change the default configuration of my main bike, my Trek Domane. The reality is that I spend 99% of my time on that bike by myself out there training and having fun. The entire reason I started thinking about [performance adventure cycling](../Fitness/Performance%20adventure%20cycling%20FTW.md) again was because I'm getting bored of the 4-hour options every day and it's starting to rain a lot more and I don't want to go out as much when it does mostly because my bike isn't setup for it. If my default bike setup is compatible with a PAC focus I can train on it—without alteration—all year long and go anywhere that I want with relatively little extra effort including most gravel roads. If I leave on my default Tailfin Aero Cargo bag I'm ready for minimal local adventures any time I want—including trips to the store for beer or whatever.

Converting my default bike into a PAC bike means [gravel over road shoes](../Fitness/Gravel%20over%20road%20shoes.md) and fat [50-50 all-road tires](../Fitness/Best%2050-50%20all-road%20tire.md) with white walls and a [TailFin Aeropack Cargo](https://www.tailfin.cc/product/rear-systems/aeropacks/aeropack/) rack. Hell, I might as well put on the aero bars as well to make up all the speed I will lose from that pack and heavier wheels. At that point most roadies won't even wave to me let alone take me seriously. Do I care? Unfortunately, yes, I hate admitting it, but I do actually care. My Strava times will all be a lot slower without really any explanation as to why. I suppose I can shut all that up with massive volume. Even roadies appreciate ultra-endurance volume and milage. When I start posting double centuries in a single day every weekend to Asheville and the coast there won't be any way *not* to know why my bike looks like that. Then when I start posting Strava segments of me crossing the fucking country, well, any cred I narcissistically care about will be satisfied.

The extra weight of the gear I'll be carrying will quickly be offset by my body weight shrinking to 67 kilos because I'll be able to comfortably increase the volume to insane levels. Most importantly, with this setup as my default I will easily be able to ride all year long in North Carolina and *want* to do so in order to train for the rough conditions of a BNSUS if I ever did one. 

Even though I don't think I'll be able to do a BNSUS I want to be *ready* to do one when and if the time comes. In fact, this is now my [long term cycling goal](../Fitness/Long%20term%20cycling%20goals.md) even if, for other reasons, I never get to take that time off and attempt it. I can let that imagery power me through all the local training I am doing now. I can also just ignore the judging asshole roadies who won't even wave at me for having aero bars. Every time that happens I'll just imagine them trying to bike across America on mixed-terrain roads on a sneeze-and-it-will-break overpriced carbon POS and smile. Most of those narcissistic pricks don't even have the volume or skill to do finish an omnium let alone a stage race in winter conditions. Tortoise beats the hare. 

Perhaps the biggest advantage of changing my goal to BNSUS is the people I will attract. I have really struggled to find a new friend group over the last few months and it mostly has to do with the activities I have been doing. The few groups road rides I tried solidified my conclusion about most roadies. Another roadie who stopped to check on me while messing with my seat and then road with me was so competitive and driven that as soon as we talked a bit he went pull gas and dropped me in 10 minutes without even so much as saying goodbye. If I'm honest, the dude was fast, but who does that? Who completely drops another rider and doesn't even look back to wave goodbye or say, "nice meeting you?" Roadies like him. That are some of the worst human beings on the planet and I don't want anything to do with them. So much so that I'm going to ride the Gran Fondos with aero bars just to make sure they stay the hell away. Aero bars are to roadies as bug repellent is to flies who eat shit. It will be kinda funny actually.

In contrast, I encountered Facebook pages of people like [Tom Hughes](https://www.facebook.com/OneTonTom) and find myself almost giddy with the possibility of ever being able to count myself among his friends group. This guys is among the salt of the Earth. The cool thing is that he's not the only one. [Riders who are attracted to performance adventure cycling](../Fitness/My%20kind%20of%20bike%20rider.md) and even just riding on gravel or bikepacking are almost always like him. DKLEIN is another one. The humans are far superior—in every way that matters—than the roadies with higher FTPs. They are impressed with "epic rides" more than stupid personal power numbers. Imma find me a bunch of them to hang out with.
