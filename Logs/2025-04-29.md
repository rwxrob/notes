After making a batch of 250ml gel flasks and waking to a beautiful sunrise without an alarm and realizing the only thing I had to prepare was a waffle and some Huel for breakfast I realized that my routine is getting really dialed in. I'm a huge believer that routine is the secret to amazing performance and happiness. Routine dramatically reduces stress as does any preparation for any activity. Knowing you are ready removed the fear factor and makes it so much easier to relax. Being able to relax makes me happier and more efficient all around. 

I recover so much faster then there is less stress. In fact, just like all the marginal gains from shaving 5 watts here and 10 watts there shaving some incalculable amount of stress from my life here and there adds up to become a substantial amount. Most recently I've even removed the stress of creating a fancy title for my Strava activity or taking any pictures or videos. I don't feel the burning demand of making a like-able activity. I just do the thing and enjoy it and use Strava as a way to keep track of it. That's it. Does it make my Strava feed boring and unfollowable? Kinda. But I make sure to make interesting posts about things that I've discovered that could potentially help someone else because I _want_ to do it, not because I feel some requirement to do it.

I recently heard a specialist in psychology talking about how much less healthy and happy people are who focus on outcomes instead of experiences. It made me think of my goals and wonder if I was doing it wrong. Ultimately, I realized that I believe it is possible to have a goal outcome while still focusing on the experience. The goal provides structure to the preparation. Then, when the event comes up I can just focus on riding my best riding and having an amazing experience pushing myself as hard as I can focused on the moment. Am I following my plan the best I can? Then whatever podium I get is what I get. The outcome goal can motivate me at the end when things are tough but focusing on the experience is sincerely what matters most.

A lot of people think that one has to have a "winning mentality" focused on destroying the competition. I don't. I'd rather be healthy and happy.
