Taking a week off to do a [1-week protein fast](../Fitness/1-week%20protein%20fast.md). Spent the day getting the bike shed so dialed in. Still some left but not much. It's so beautiful. Decided to do my own tubeless tire setup and will be using [Squirt Seal](https://youtu.be/WU3jaM5tDoI?si=ct29I4-Q4LBXU4NG&t=240) on my mountain and gravel bike wheels since it looks best to fix big gashes
