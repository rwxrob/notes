Good morning! What a great day, just cold out. Today's gonna be a tough one because I don't have tubes to replace my flat yet and I need to get a long endurance ride in. I think instead I will put the heart rate monitor on and do a low-impact endurance cleaning session to finally get my storage room and bike shed in proper order. I can count it as an endurance workout if I keep the pace high enough while I am doing it.
