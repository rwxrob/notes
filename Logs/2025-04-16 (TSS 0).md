Good morning! What a great day, just cold out.

Today's gonna be a tough one because I don't have tubes to replace my flat yet and I need to get a long endurance ride in. I think I'll just do an indoor ride and some cleaning instead.

I'm really enjoying the focused weight training. I can already feel the results on the bike and I don't get sore from it like weight training in the past. There's something to be said for low
