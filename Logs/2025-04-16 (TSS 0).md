Good morning! What a great day, just cold out.

Today's gonna be a tough one because I don't have tubes to replace my flat yet and I need to get a long endurance ride in. I think I'll just do an indoor ride and some cleaning instead.

I'm really enjoying the focused weight training now that I understand the different [types of weight training](../Cycling/Types%20of%20weight%20training.md)â€”particularly the difference between focus on power versus hypertrophy. I can already feel the results on the bike and I don't get sore from it like weight training in the pastâ€”especially my back. When I was a triathlete I looked good but didn't have the same power because I was doing too many reps and using leg machines instead of squats. I had strong glutes and quads but not my back and obliques to hold it all together. It wasn't bad, just not as much.

No workout today, but did have a massive itchy/bloated attack from something I ate. I had one yesterday that woke me up from a nap. I spent an hour or so working it out with my AI (which I've done before). As I itemized everything in my [ðŸ¥— Training Day Nutrition Plan](../Cycling/ðŸ¥—%20Training%20Day%20Nutrition%20Plan.md) she kept commenting on different things and when I added rice + lentils she said, "Boom, that's what's blowing you up." Apparently, I was creating th e
