[Bike events](../Cycling/Bike%20events.md) have been added to the calendar. One a month.

I really regret signing up for 24 Hours of Booty. Seemed like the right thing to do but seriously not worth the hassle or expense. I could have paid for two Gran Fondo events with that money. It's the week between Gran Fondo Asheville and Gran Fondo Boone meaning I won't be pushing super hard because it will tank my performance for the one in Boone the next week and kill my recovery from Asheville where I want do do well.
