[Annual bike events](../Fitness/Annual%20bike%20events.md) have been added to the calendar. At least one a month, sometimes more.

I've realized all my desire to do bike touring and adventure cycling all this time was really me just wanting to do epic, competitive rides regularly in pretty places with equally committed people to the sport.

I signed up for RAIN but am forgetting it. Too slow and disorganized compared to the Suarez series. I won't be signing up for RAGBRAI ever either. Even Assault on Mt. Mitchell falls into that sketchy minimally managed category. I also somewhat regret doing NC Mountains to Coast. These are for people who would actually wear a jersey that says, "I rode 160 miles" when to anyone doing the Gran Fondo series that's like, "you mean, like last weekend in training." The level of people with whom I want to associate are those that will push me in the best way to pull the best performance out of my legs possible. I have nothing against all those who love to ride bikes in their own way. I just have a level I want to surround myself with as much as possible that that level is in the UCI sanctioned, professionally managed Suarez Gran Fondo series. There's just no doubt about it.

I really regret signing up for 24 Hours of Booty. Seemed like the right thing to do but seriously not worth the hassle or expense. I could have paid for two Gran Fondo events with that money. It's the week between Gran Fondo Asheville and Gran Fondo Boone meaning I won't be pushing super hard because it will tank my performance for the one in Boone the next week and kill my recovery from Asheville where I want do do well.

NC Mountains to Coast suffers from one major flaw: I sleep in a tent every day and have to set it up and get my own meals. It's been a very hard realization to own that I just want to ride my bikeâ€”fast. The only camping I ever want to do is in my car waiting for the event the next morning. I have all this adventure cycling camping gear and bags and stuff and to be completely honest I don't think I will ever use it again after this years NC Mountains to Coast. Hell, I don't even know if I'll end up using the mountain bike I bought, like at all. With the number of races I have lined up taking a risk on a jump line just isn't worth it. I might enter a XC race but with Love Valley being light gravel that's all I ever really want to do.

Mountain biking during the Summer in NC sucks for many reasons that are not obvious. I tried it in 2010. That's why I got into paddle-boarding. The heat and humidity in the forest climbing super steep grades for a little downhill here and there is just torture. Road riding doesn't suffer from that as much because there is almost always some sort of wind to cool you down and you are generally going a lot faster to produce that wind. When there is a slow section of climbing there is always a very fast descent that is like putting you into a wind tunnel to cool off. That doesn't happen mountain biking. Plus, all the mountain bike trails completely close in the Winter.

Nope, I think I've discovered my happy place. Competitive Gran Fondos that are professionally managed and sanctioned by the UCI. They are functionally equivalent to marathons but for bikes. They are also something an old guy like me can do well into his 90s (and people do).
