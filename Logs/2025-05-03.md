After thinking a lot about how and when I want to ride I decided that the NC Mountains to Coast and NC Coastal Ride are events I do want to add  to my [annual events calendar](../Cycling/Annual%20bike%20events.md). The cost is a no-brainer given what I would pay otherwise. They provide an overabundance of bike culture including serious riders relaxing and getting some volume in. Plus they are huge promotions of the bike riding ethos and fully supported by the state, local communities, and law enforcement. Aid stations are ridiculously well stocked meaning I can leave the performance gel at home if I want for these. The amount of variety means that I can either ride with a group or push myself in training but given the scenic and varying nature of these routes every year I will be choosing to go long and very slow with as many other people as I can. This is just one big huge group ride without the stress of attacking and chasing nor the fear of someone doing something stupid and taking everyone down. Basically, they just take the edge off the volume of training required to be a competitive GC age-grouper at Gran Fondo distances and terrains (which are the single closest thing to TdF-like stages in America).

After a lot of thought and interaction with my AI I've concluded I likely won't be needing another road bike for a very long time. My Domane AL 5 Gen 4 has everything I need and want except maybe electronic shifting and better aero bars. I'm even more convinced of this now that I know that to transport a bike by air I'd have to take the pedals off which means that regularly swapping the pedals between road (Look style) and SPD is not a big deal. Since I already have a [perfect wheel set collection](../Cycling/Perfect%20wheel%20set%20collection.md) for every occasion all I have to do is swap wheels and pedals to ride gravel or social events with lots of walking around. The endurance geometry and gearing is already gravel-friendly enough to do all the gravel I could ever care about. Plus, by pairing this all with Tailfin Aeropack I could even do some gravel bikepacking in the area, although, on second thought, [I don't have time for bikepacking](../Cycling/Events%20instead%20of%20bikepacking.md).
