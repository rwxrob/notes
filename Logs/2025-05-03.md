After thinking a lot about how and when I want to ride I decided that the NC Mountains to Coast and NC Coastal Ride are events I do want to add  to my [annual events calendar](../Cycling/Annual%20bike%20events.md). The cost is a no-brainer given what I would pay otherwise. They provide an overabundance of bike culture including serious riders relaxing and getting some volume in. Plus they are huge promotions of the bike riding ethos and fully supported by the state, local communities, and law enforcement. Aid stations are ridiculously well stocked meaning I can leave the performance  The amount of variety means that I can either ride with a group or push myself in training. Given the scenic and varying nature of these routes every year I will be choosing to go long and very slow with as many other people as I can. This is just one big huge group ride without the stress of attacking and chasing nor the fear of someone doing something stupid and taking everyone down. Basically, they just take the edge off the volume of training required to be a competitive GC age-grouper at Gran Fondo distances and terrains (which are the single closest thing to TdF-like stages in America).
