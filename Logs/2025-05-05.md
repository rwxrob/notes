Beautiful day to *not* ride my bike. Packing and flying to see family over this week. If I'm lucky, the Peloton bike at the hotel will be free enough to maintain some level of fitness while I'm there.

I did have a few thoughts to capture, however:

- [It's not the size of your watts, it's how you use them](../Cycling/It's%20not%20the%20size%20of%20your%20watts,%20it's%20how%20you%20use%20them.md)
- [Gran Fondos for fun instead of competition](../Cycling/Gran%20Fondos%20for%20fun%20instead%20of%20competition.md)

In the airport hoping I don't lose all my fitness gains on this trip this week. I did check and my hotel has a Peloton bike so I brought my shoes for it. Hopefully I can do some high intensity stuff in the early morning or something before our vacation stuff. Next week is Cheaha.
