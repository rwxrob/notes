Beautiful day to *not* ride my bike. Packing and flying to see family over this week. If I'm lucky, the Peloton bike at the hotel will be free enough to maintain some level of fitness while I'm there.

I did have a few thoughts to capture, however:

In the airport hoping I don't lose all my fitness gains on this trip this week. I did check and my hotel has a Peloton bike so I brought my shoes for it. Hopefully I can do some high intensity stuff in the early morning or something before our vacation stuff. Next week is Cheaha. I really hope my photo-chromatic Rudy Spinshield Airs get here before then. I have the 11% smoke black ones and the 13% multilaser orange and they are definitely too dark for the shaded roads and sometimes grey skies around here. I just noticed that they are 13-62%, however, so they are darker than my smoke black 11%. They do make a 8-48% that's purple with white frames. Not really my thing but that shading is ideal for overcast days.

OMG, only McDonald's open. McDouble at least has two slices of tomato. My stomach is already revolting. This is why America is so fucked.
