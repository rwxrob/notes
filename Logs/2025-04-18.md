Today was the first day with a Whoop. It says I'm fully recovered, already. Here's the thing. I did a 2.5 hour base ride yesterday and I barely feel tired or sore now. I could easily do another one today. Dillon Johnson says he assesses what to do every morning based on how he feels. I think I'm going to generally do the same.

I've been reminded that I don't do anything active all day, nothing stressful except maybe a bit of mental stress from work. This means that even a two our Z1-Z2 ride is nothing more than what most people would do during the day at their jobs in addition to whatever training they are doing. In other words, getting on the bike for two hours a day—everyday—should not impact anything. Then I can vary the intensity for the training element of it.

I also think I am going to start heading out much earlier, leaving at 9am instead of 10, which I had already pushed from 11am. According to my AI, 8:45 to 2:30 is the optimal window to be on the roads during school season, preferably before lunch traffic around noon. The biggest problem is the temperature in the edge seasons at that time. 9am is still cold, not as cold at 7am, but cold. I don't like going on training rides when I have to switch up my clothes during the ride but I _need_ to get really good at that since most Gran Fondos and group rides start in the cold hours before 9am. If I'm seriously going to continue training outside through the winter then I have to not even think about it. I have to build my weather confidence back up by doing it a lot.

I'm going to keep strength training for three days a weeks except Peak or Race weeks and just do it at night after the sun goes down. At my age this is mandatory. I see older, active people everyday here in Davidson and Huntersville who look like they are completely sarcopenic. Maybe they are, but it's more likely they just do not prioritize muscle development and strength. In fact, as much as I want power more than just muscle size (the reason for low reps at high weight) I realize that I probably _want_ hypertrophy to counter natural Sarcopenia. I also need to be sure and get a whole body routine to remain balanced instead of just working the legs (even though the legs are by far the most important going into old age for stabilization).

Okay that was a tempo ride even though I thought I was riding in zone 2. I let myself dance up too many hills and I also think my perceived FTP has been affected by my heavy weight training three times a week. After working it out with my AI I'm going to set my FTP back to 230 while hitting the weights hard and consider 2025 as "the year of base and technique" so I can get body composition dialed in and the base engine stacked and restore all my riding skills from previous years. I also have to have several surgeries this year. I'll end 2025 with optimal watts per kilo without working focusing on FTP at all. Then 2026 I can really dial in that engine, boost the FTP and durability for performance with a proper base/build/peak/race cycle. I'm going to update my [annual plan - 2025](../Fitness/2025%20annual%20plan.md) to reflect the change in goals.
