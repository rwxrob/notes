Ugh, no training for me today. Too much work and prep for the new apartment layout so I can get out of the storage unit. Tons of hard physical work now to do mostly solo. I can kiss my fitness level for the Asheville Gran Fondo goodbye. I'll be happy to even just finish 100 miles within a decent time at this point.
