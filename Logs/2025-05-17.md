Welp. Today I'm supposed to be driving to Jackson, Alabama for the Cheaha Challenge but I'm not. After talking through yet another last minute change and email from tMy wife has (wisely) helped confirm that my doubts about it are justified. I'm pretty pissed off that I ever signed up for it in the first place.
