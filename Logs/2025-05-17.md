Decided to cut my losses and not to even drive to Cheaha Challenge which has become [a bad joke](../Fitness/Cheaha%20Challenge%20is%20a%20bad%20joke.md) which I probably should have expected from Alabama, which is the shittiest state in the nation by every subjective and objective measure.

GFNats is a climbing competition, period. Every single major major event is won based on climbing segments that average 6% or higher. They might have flats and a bit of descent but pack dynamics, aerodynamics, and race skills matter very little compared to raw climbing ability. Not even durability matters because everyone can do the absolute minimum on the non-timed segments and effectively fully recover before the next all-out climb. People don't even have to keep up with the lead pack or risk losing their position. Even top riders will be doing 18 kph maximum up hills like that. At that speed weight and rolling resistance are extremely important. This changes everything about my preparation for Asheville (a proper, timed-segment Gran Fondo).

For starters, I'm putting some ultra light 32m tubeless tires on. Hitting those small bumps in the road going up that kind of grade
