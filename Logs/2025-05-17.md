Decided to cut my losses and not to even drive to Cheaha Challenge which has become [a bad joke](../Fitness/Cheaha%20Challenge%20is%20a%20bad%20joke.md) which I probably should have expected from Alabama, which is the shittiest state in the nation by every subjective and objective measure.

Instead, I'm am now solidly [focused on GFNat timed climb segment events only](../Fitness/GFNat%20focus.md).

After all the gusty winds today it has become clear that my 63mm deep dish wheels need to go. All they do is get me in trouble. On group rides they are very sketch because the wind pushes me all over unsafely in the peloton. They also make me way faster on the descents which inevitably makes me cross wheels with the person in front on minor descents. Plus they are heavier than climbing wheels of the same caliber. The question now is should I get climbing wheels or wait and just get a climbing bike like the Madone and use the wheels it comes with. I can keep my deep dish for time trials and things, which I still want to also do. In fact, time trialing is one of the things I enjoyed the most from the Nike Masters competition. I just don't have the build for it. I'm half way between a sprinter build and a climber build which, I suppose, means once I have the fitness I could do GC pretty well. Since I'm going for competitive Gran Fondos and they are all about climbing I'm going to build a climber body even if that means I might struggle with sarcopenia later in life. I can always pack muscle on other ways. Or I could just accept climbing at 72 kg instead and build a yoga body. There are lots of options all of which involve me dropping about 10 more kilos. I'll get there. I've already made a lot of progress. The most important thing I have to watch is not caloric intake but elevated stress hormones that cause me to pack weight on. Intensity is the devil at this stage in my body construction phase.

So after doing a ton of research I've decided to go back to the stock wheels and put # Continental Grand Prix 5000 All Season 700x28 AS TR Black Reflex tubeless on them so I can run them.
