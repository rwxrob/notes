Welp. Today I'm supposed to be driving to Jackson, Alabama for the Cheaha Challenge but I'm not. After talking through yet another last minute change and email from the race director my wife has (wisely) helped confirm that my doubts about this event are very valid. She agrees with my decision to just cut my losses ($130) and go for a century ride around here instead.

I'm pretty pissed off that I ever signed up for Cheaha in the first place and very strongly recommend against anyone ever doing it. I don't see how this event ever qualified as a "partner" for GFNats. It's nothing more than a last-minute organized, underfunded, understaffed local Fondo except now they have *tons* of people to deal with since it is a UCI qualifier (which it should NEVER have earned, imo).

In fact, this entire fiasco has me rethinking my entire dedication to GFNat at all. It hasn't reduced my passion for performance and fitness just opened my eyes to realities I didn't see or chose to ignore. I got into these events because GFNat seems to have addresses my main concern with such events from the past. Will some say that my "red flags" are just stupid on my part? Absolutely. But I've done more of these events that most people saying that have and I just don't have to put up with it. That's the great thing about being were I am. I don't have to care.

Here are the last straws that convinced me (in addition to [these reasons](../Fitness/First%20and%20last%20Cheaha%20for%20me.md)) not to even waste the gas to drive to Cheaha.

The day before the event the director sends a last minute notification that the route has changed. The most scenic and interesting loop inside the state park has been chopped entirely from the route because of "the hotel construction" (who builds a hotel in the middle of a fucking state park?) that they have known about for the better part of a year. This is in addition to the announcement that a massive sink hole has claimed a segment of the road for the Ultra event requiring a last minute change just last week.

The most important rest stop was previously in the state park. Now they are trying to do it at the trailhead after a portion of the descent after what is a u-turn in the middle of the road with no traffic control. Let's see the racers pull that shit off. The people most affected by this are in my age group, 55+ because they are *forced* to take the hair-pin u-turn while all the other age groups are not. This means that the slow under 55 racers will be grouped with the fast over 55 racers who overtake them. This would normally be fine. In fact, I was counting on it. But because the over 55 have to do the u-turn that peloton group will be insanely stupid dangerous at that point of the u-turn. Competitive riders (like me) would use that turn as an opportunity to break away only to be stopped by people going straight with no way to tell who is going to turn and who is going straight. That point in the ride was *already* a competitive moment since it would allow faster riders to break away in the state park before the change, now it's even worse because the hairpin turn is followed by a descent. Competitive minded riders would use this to descend as fast as possible and build a gap. This is compounded by the fact that as soon as they hit speed the first major left turn is congested with a last minute rest stop

The rest stop is no where near as big, positioned on a hairpin, blind turn, and has deliriously people coming up the end of the climb in the other lane. This means people will be slamming their breaks on to get to the rest stop while others that want to just get through it will have no where to go. It's one of the dumbest decisions I have ever seen in all of my cycling event history and the entire thing could have been avoided by knowing *in advance* that the entire park was going to be closed *before* selling everyone tickets to this event. The level of incompetence not knowing that until *the day before the event* is fucking astounding. 

The email talks about no ice rags this year because "\[they\] almost lost rights to go through the park last year" because of them being thrown around. Reading this after seeing the "no packs" rule and the videos of race packs filled with tons of people regularly crossing the center line to get an illegal lead reminded me what total entitled shitheads most competitive cyclists areâ€”even the old ones. These are the same kind of people who destroy hotel towels cleaning their chains on Tour Divide. Unfortunately, this sport is overrun with absolute assholes who think the rules don't apply to them and they are never wrong. It's perhaps the single biggest reason I got out of the sport.

The email says that police will be on the road "at times" rather than regularly policing for violators confirming my suspicion that there is no serious dedication to rules enforcement at all in this event. There is a lot of lip service in scary emails but nothing with teeth.

I also saw a video of the entire race being stopped at the top of the climb in the state park after airlifting a person off the mountain who missed a turn on the descent. This eliminated the entire race dynamic of that part of the event.

In short, I had my doubts before that email, they were completely solidified when I read it. Cheaha is a fucking joke and honestly the more people who know that in advance the better.
