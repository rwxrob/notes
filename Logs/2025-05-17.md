Decided to cut my losses and not to even drive to Cheaha Challenge which has become [a bad joke](../Fitness/Cheaha%20Challenge%20is%20a%20bad%20joke.md) which I probably should have expected from Alabama, which is the shittiest state in the nation by every subjective and objective measure.

GFNats is a climbing competition, period. Every single major major event is won based on climbing segments that average 6% or higher. They might have flats and a bit of descent but pack dynamics, aerodynamics, and race skills matter very little compared to raw climbing ability. Not even durability matters because everyone can do the absolute minimum on the non-timed segments and effectively fully recover before the next all-out climb. People don't even have to keep up with the lead pack or risk losing their position. Even top riders will be doing 18 kph maximum up hills like that. At that speed weight and rolling resistance are extremely important. This changes everything about my preparation for Asheville (a proper, timed-segment Gran Fondo):

- Lowest weight possible: 68 kg or less
- Lightest bike possible
- Best rolling resistance possible
- Best nutrition management
- Hill climbing adaptation

**Dropping weight.**  Lower weight matters way more than higher power for all of these events. In fact, building FTP is a horrible idea until weight is in an acceptable area. I was shooting for 70 kg but now I'm going to go even lower. This means tons more base training miles to keep a healthy caloric deficit. I'll only be able to hit 72 for Asheville but should hit 68 by Nationals. I cannot screw this up. It's the most important thing I can do besides maintain base fitness.

**Lighten bike.** My bike is already as light as it can go. I'll just not carry my phone nor my pump and pack. I'm also going to practice emptying a 750 ml bottle completely and only doing the climb with a single empty one. All the climbs are reasonably within the tolerance of doing it intensely and recovering after it is done so carrying any extra water is really bad. This is especially true because I can fully recover at a rest stop after pushing to my maximum and burning all the matches on every climb segment.

**Rolling resistance.** I'm going to put some ultra light 32m tubeless tires on my aero wheels (which are still lighter than every other wheel set I have). Hitting those small bumps in the road going up that kind of grade has a tremendous impact on forward momentum and balance. Running a much lower air pressure is far more important than having an aero tire. This also makes the recovery on the long distances in between timed segments that much more cozy and also enables me to last longer in the saddle when doing training rides, which I've decided again will be at least three hours every time.

**Nutrition from aid stations.** Carrying my own nutrition up the hill is a huge liabilityâ€”especially for the first two climb segments. Trying to carry the calories I need to fuel the entire event with me during the whole event is simply foolish. It would probably weigh almost a full kilogram of extra weight when I could just refuel at the support stations. This is *only* because of the timed segment setup. The Suarez official events are also well stocked with actual good fuel sources so I likely do not need anything. I do, however, need to practice gut training for the exact same foods that will be available at the aide stations and I need to do the research to determine what that will be.

**Hill climb training.** I do have a lot of hills in my normal training but I don't currently have a lot of *long* hills. I need to scope those out and ride only those since those are the segments I will be timed on. I really need t
