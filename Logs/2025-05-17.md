Decided to cut my losses and not to even drive to Cheaha Challenge which has become [a bad joke](../Fitness/Cheaha%20Challenge%20is%20a%20bad%20joke.md) which I probably should have expected from Alabama, which is the shittiest state in the nation by every subjective and objective measure.

Instead, I'm am now solidly [focused on GFNat timed climb segment events only](../Fitness/GFNat%20focus.md).

After all the gusty winds today it has become clear that my 63mm deep dish wheels need to go. All they do is get me in trouble. On group rides they are very sketch because the wind pushes me all over unsafely in the peloton. They also make me way faster on the descents which inevitably makes me cross wheels with the person in front on minor descents. Plus they are heavier than climbing wheels of the same caliber. The question now is should I get climbing wheels or wait and just get a climbing bike like the Madone.
