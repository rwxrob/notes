Welp. Today I'm supposed to be driving to Jackson, Alabama for the Cheaha Challenge but I'm not. After talking through yet another last minute change and email from the race director my wife has (wisely) helped confirm that my doubts about this event and helped validate my decision to just cut my losses and go for a century ride around here instead. I'm pretty pissed off that I ever signed up for Cheaha in the first place and very strongly recommend against anyone ever doing it. I don't see how this event ever qualified as a "partner" for GFNats. In fact, this entire fiasco has me rethinking my entire dedication to GFNat at all. It hasn't reduced my passion for performance and fitness just opened my eyes to realities I didn't see or chose to ignore. Will some say that my "red flags" are just stupid on my part? Absolutely. That's the great thing about being were I am. I don't have to care. Here are the last straws that convinced me (in addition to [these reasons](../Fitness/First%20and%20last%20Cheaha%20for%20me.md)) not to even waste the gas to drive to it:

The day before the event the director sends a last minute notification that the route has changed. The most scenic and interesting loop inside the state park has been chopped entirely from the route because of "the hotel construction" that they have known about for the better part of a year. This is in addition to the announcement that a massive sink hole has claimed a segment of the road for the Ultra event requiring a last minute change just last week.

The most important rest stop was previously in the state park. Now they are trying to do it at the trailhead after a portion of the descent after what is a u-turn in the middle of the fucking road with no traffic control

The email talks about no ice rags this year because "\[they\] almost lost rights to go through the park last year" because of them being thrown around. Reading this after seeing the "no packs" rule and the videos of race packs filled with tons of people regularly crossing the center line to get an illegal lead reminded me what total entitled shitheads most competitive cyclists areâ€”even the old ones. These are the same kind of people who destroy hotel towels cleaning their chains on Tour Divide. Unfortunately, this sport is overrun with absolute assholes who think the rules don't apply to them and they are never wrong. It's perhaps the single biggest reason I got out of the sport.

The email says that police will be on the road "at times" rather than regularly policing for violators confirming my suspicion that there is no serious dedication to rules enforcement at all in this event. There is a lot of lip service in scary emails but nothing with teeth.

I also saw a video of the entire race being stopped at the top of the climb in the state park after airlifting a person off the mountain who missed a turn on the descent. This eliminated the entire race dynamic of that part of the event.
