Decided to cut my losses and not to even drive to Cheaha Challenge which has become [a bad joke](../Fitness/Cheaha%20Challenge%20is%20a%20bad%20joke.md) which I probably should have expected from Alabama, which is the shittiest state in the nation by every subjective and objective measure.

Instead, I'm am now solidly [focused on GFNat timed climb segment events only](../Fitness/GFNat%20focus.md).
