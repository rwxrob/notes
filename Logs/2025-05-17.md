Welp. Today I'm supposed to be driving to Jackson, Alabama for the Cheaha Challenge but I'm not. After talking through yet another last minute change and email from the race director my wife has (wisely) helped confirm that my doubts about this event and helped validate my decision to just cut my losses and go for a century ride around here instead. I'm pretty pissed off that I ever signed up for Cheaha in the first place and very strongly recommend against anyone ever doing it. I don't see how this event ever qualified as a "partner" for GFNats. In fact, this entire fiasco has me rethinking my entire dedication to GFNat at all. It hasn't reduced my passion for performance and fitness just opened my eyes to realities I didn't see or chose to ignore. Will some say that my "red flags" are just stupid on my part? Absolutely. That's the great thing about being were I am. I don't have to care. Here are the last straws that convinced me (in addition to [these reasons](../Fitness/First%20and%20last%20Cheaha%20for%20me.md)) not to even waste the gas to drive to it:

The day before the event the director sends a last minute notification that the route has changed. The most scenic and interesting loop inside the state park has been chopped entirely from the route because of "the hotel construction" that they have known about for the better part of a year. This is in addition to the announcement that a massive sink hole has claimed a segment of the road for the Ultra event requiring a last minute change just last week.

The email talks about no ice rags this year because "\[they\] almost lost rights to go through the park last year" because of them being thrown around.

The emails says that police will be on the road "at times" rather than regularly policing for violators

I also saw a video of the entire race being stopped at the top of the climb in the state park after airlifting a person off the mountain who missed a turn on the descent. This eliminated the entire race dynamic of that part of the event.
