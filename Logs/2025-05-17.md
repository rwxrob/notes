Decided to cut my losses and not to even drive to Cheaha Challenge which has become [a bad joke](../Fitness/Cheaha%20Challenge%20is%20a%20bad%20joke.md) which I probably should have expected from Alabama, which is the shittiest state in the nation by every subjective and objective measure.

GFNats is a climbing competition, period. Every single major major event is won based on climbing segments that average 6% or higher. They might have flats and a bit of descent but pack dynamics, aerodynamics, and race skills matter very little compared to raw climbing ability. Not even durability matters because everyone can do the absolute minimum on the non-timed segments and effectively fully recover before the next all-out climb. People don't even have to keep up with the lead pack or risk losing their position. Even top riders will be doing 18 kph maximum up hills like that. At that speed weight and rolling resistance are extremely important. This changes everything about my preparation for Asheville (a proper, timed-segment Gran Fondo):

- Lowest weight possible: 68 kg or less
- Lightest bike possible
- Best rolling resistance possible
- Best nutrition management

**Dropping weight.**  Lower weight matters way more than higher power for all of these events. In fact, building FTP is a horrible idea until weight is in an acceptable area. I was shooting for 70 kg but now I'm going to go even lower. This means tons more base training miles to keep a healthy caloric deficit. I'll only be able to hit 72 for Asheville, but 

**Rolling resistance.** I'm going to put some ultra light 32m tubeless tires on my aero wheels (which are still lighter than every other wheel set I have). Hitting those small bumps in the road going up that kind of grade has a tremendous impact on forward momentum and balance. Running a much lower air pressure is far more important than having an aero tire. This also makes the recovery on the long distances in between timed segments that much more cozy and also enables me to last longer in the saddle when doing training rides, which I've decided again will be at least three hours every time.
