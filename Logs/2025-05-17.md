Decided to cut my losses and not to even drive to Cheaha Challenge which has become [a bad joke](../Bikes/Cheaha%20Challenge%20is%20a%20bad%20joke.md) which I probably should have expected from Alabama. Yeah, I really hate Alabama, objectively the worst state in the nation by every objective measure even though I'm sure there are a lot of amazing, wonderful people living there.  I'm sorry. I'm cussing up a storm today. I was looking forward to Cheaha and now I'm pissed. Probably for the best. I am *really* looking forward to Asheville, my favorite city in all of the great state of North Carolina.

Instead, I'm am now solidly [focused on GFNat timed climb segment events only](../Fitness/GFNats%20training%20strategy.md).

Just back from ride. After all the gusty winds today it has become clear that my 63mm deep dish wheels need to go. All they do is get me in trouble. On group rides they are very sketch because the wind pushes me all over unsafely in the peloton. They also make me way faster on the descents which inevitably makes me cross wheels with the person in front on minor descents. Plus they are heavier than climbing wheels of the same caliber.

The question now is should I get climbing wheels or wait and just get a climbing bike like the Madone and use the wheels it comes with? I can keep my deep dish for time trials and things, which I still want to also do. Plus there are a lot of times when flat fast aero is a thing, like perhaps even the LNGF. Time trialing is one of the things I enjoyed the most from the Nike Masters competition. I just don't have the build for it. I'm half way between a sprinter build and a climber build which, I suppose, means once I have the fitness I could do GC pretty well.

Since I'm going for competitive Gran Fondos and they are all about climbing I'm going to build a climber body even if that means I might struggle with sarcopenia later in life. I can always pack muscle on other ways. Or I could just accept climbing at 72 kg instead and build a yoga body. There are lots of options all of which involve me dropping about 10 more kilos. I'll get there. I've already made a lot of progress. The most important thing I have to watch is not caloric intake but elevated stress hormones that cause me to pack weight on. Intensity is the devil at this stage in my body construction phase.

So after getting blown off the road practically today by cross winds and monstrous head winds and doing a ton of research I've decided to put Continental Grand Prix 5000 All Season 700x28 AS TR Black Reflex tubeless on my aluminum Swiss Side PION AL wheel set (that came free with the carbon aero wheels). They are 400g lighter than the stock AL wheels, have DT Swiss hubs, and since the rims themselves are lighter than the aero rims are pretty much perfect for climbing, which is the new main focus I need for timed-climbing-segment Gran Fondos coming up. The aero wheels are lighter (200 grams) but the weight distribution makes them much harder to accelerate on a climb where gravity immediately decelerates more than on flat. And since the descents and flats never matter because they are not timed at all I really don't care about aero. I want light weight, snappy acceleration on the hills and rock-solid stability in the peloton (instead of being blown all around). Hell, I might even try a group ride or two again once I get to my goal weight. 

Oh, here's my tire pressure for 28c at my current 80 kg weight:

|**Conditions**|**Front / Rear Pressure (psi)**|
|---|---|
|**Dry, smooth roads**|**62 / 65 psi**|
|**Mixed chipseal / rough**|**58 / 61 psi**|
|**Wet / early morning dampness**|**56 / 59 psi**|
Also, I'm not interested in a new bike at all. I have the best aluminum Domane there is and with these wheels will have everything I need for years. Carbon is shit. It cost double the price for only 800 less grams but is so fragile and expensive it has to be completely babied everywhere. If I ever wanted to do fast bike packing I couldn't. If I ever did get carbon it would be for a Madone and I really don't need that at all for 90% of my riding. My Domane with three wheel sets for aero, climbing, and light gravel is absolutely idealâ€”especially since I have life-time flat repair and adding new sealant for free with Trek and it applies to every *bike* not wheel set. I literally have the bike that will encourage me to ride it the most and in the most practical and varied ways. Now if I could just get the cranks to stop creaking again. Most of the riders out there with super expensive collections of bikes don't put near the volume in that I do on the road. That's all I need to know. Eventually, my fitness and body composition will catch up and anyone looking down at my bike will also have to watch me riding it past them while I drop them on the climbs. ðŸ˜Ž
