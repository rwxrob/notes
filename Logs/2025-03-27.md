After realizing my Goblin route is fine for all my riding as a [shameless suburban sprinter](../Fitness/Shameless%20suburban%20sprinter%20(not%20anymore).md) I can do it anytime of the day or night or week due to how safe and consistent the traffic is, I realized I can add the Saturday century ride as a weekly thing and also add lunchtime [strength and core training](../Fitness/Strength%20and%20core%20training.md) a couple days a week, forever.

The Saturday century is just to promote all the other factors that prevent long rides and keep my nutrition strategy dialed in.

The volume might seem high and unrealistic to others but it really isn't compared to what adventure cyclists do on the daily. Again, I'm not doing this to beat anyone else. I'm doing it because I love it.

I had some asshole say I had "too much time on my hands" just for shopping in the middle of the day during the power outage and getting a free chicken. I literally _could not work_ and I'm also a nearly retired senior citizen, lol. I had to just shake my head. What a clueless, sad, pathetic existence that person must have. The best part was how silly it sounded to me immediately. All the other commenters where very positive and laughed. That's life. I see all types of people every single day and I couldn't be happier to have the chance to practice staying positive no matter what.

I don't have a lot going on in my life at the moment and I kind of like it that way. My simple daily routine keeps me so filled with joy on the daily that very few other things in life phase me or attract me. I *never* want this feeling to go away. In fact, I'm feeling rather protective of it at this point. 

It's not like it was when I had a family to raise, business of my own to build, or even a livestream community to keep satisfied. There days it's just me doing what makes me supremely content without the need to have any of it seen or validated by others. These notes are for me. Strava is fun and informational, a way to track personal progress. The support from people on Strava is nice but I don't _need_ it.

I'm here every night making popcorn for my wife so she can snuggle up and fall asleep on the big couch pillow on my lap while we watch whatever and I get to admire her beautiful grey hair that literally sparkles. Life is so damn good, the simpler, the better.
