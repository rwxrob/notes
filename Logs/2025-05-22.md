I feel so fantastic waking up at 7:35 this morning. Have to think about everything I did right yesterday. I honestly feel like I could go out and do another century today. I'll finish the workday and then do a 2x20 @95% interval session concluding my 3 back to back rides and take tomorrow as a recovery. I think the biggest thing I got right was just enough recovery carbs and protein without going to extreme for the entire day. I also had no sign of allergy when I woke up. Not sure why that is. Here are only things significantly different that I did yesterday:

- Some 20-minute power work during 4-hour ride
- Tons of carbs including rice crispy treats during ride
- No Huel or protein powder during day, eggs instead

Pretty sure I came in under the amount of daily protein I need.

I absolutely love [training by block and feel](../Fitness/Training%20by%20block%20and%20feel.md) instead of the constant stress of not blowing up all the time spent on a full ATP where if I miss a day everything collapses. In fact, this year my training has been entirely adaptive and dynamic. All I need to know is what is the next big event I'm training for and then create out one block at a time that leads to that. If I need to cut a block short, no problem. If I get a hint that I need to focus on something that is waning I can adapt it for the next block. The flexibility literally aides my recovery because all the stress just melts away. To an almost OCD guy like me this *really* helps. I know I can let life happen and not be stressed that it is going to destroy anything long term.

While weighing myself today I was annoyed that I cannot sync my weight to my Garmin Connect app so [I bought a Garmin Index scale and blood pressure meter](../Fitness/Garmin%20Index%20scale%20and%20blood%20pressure.md) with my HSA money from former employer that is just sitting around on a card that will expire in about a year. I also have heard from several pros who matter-of-factly mentioned that W/kg is their primary indicator on their bike computers since that is the number that makes them competitive. It's also the number used everywhere within Zwift. Having that number as the main one I glance at
