I feel so fantastic waking up at 7:35 this morning. Have to think about everything I did right yesterday. I honestly feel like I could go out and do another century today. I'll finish the workday and then do a 2x20 @95% interval session concluding my 3 back to back rides and take tomorrow as a recovery. I think the biggest thing I got right was just enough recovery carbs and protein without going to extreme for the entire day. I also had no sign of allergy 

I absolutely love [training by block and feel](../Fitness/Training%20by%20block%20and%20feel.md) instead of the constant stress of not blowing up all the time spent on a full ATP where if I miss a day everything collapses. In fact, this year my training has been entirely adaptive and dynamic. All I need to know is what is the next big event I'm training for and then create out one block at a time that leads to that. If I need to cut a block short, no problem. If I get a hint that I need to focus on something that is waning I can adapt it for the next block. The flexibility literally aides my recovery because all the stress just melts away. To an almost OCD guy like me this *really* helps. I know I can let life happen and not be stressed that it is going to destroy anything long term.
