I feel so fantastic waking up at 7:35 this morning. Have to think about everything I did right yesterday. I honestly feel like I could go out and do another century today. I'll finish the workday and then do a 2x20 @95% interval session concluding my 3 back to back rides and take tomorrow as a recovery. I think the biggest thing I got right was just enough recovery carbs and protein without going to extreme for the entire day. I also had no sign of allergy when I woke up. Not sure why that is. Here are only things significantly different that I did yesterday:

- Some 20-minute power work during 4-hour ride
- Tons of carbs including rice crispy treats during ride
- No Huel or protein powder during day, eggs instead

Pretty sure I came in under the amount of daily protein I need.

I did notice today that the second cup of coffee (200ml instead of 100ml) made me really tired. That didn't happen yesterday.

I absolutely love [training by block and feel](../Fitness/Training%20by%20block%20and%20feel.md) instead of the constant stress of not blowing up all the time spent on a full ATP where if I miss a day everything collapses. In fact, this year my training has been entirely adaptive and dynamic. All I need to know is what is the next big event I'm training for and then create out one block at a time that leads to that. If I need to cut a block short, no problem. If I get a hint that I need to focus on something that is waning I can adapt it for the next block. The flexibility literally aides my recovery because all the stress just melts away. To an almost OCD guy like me this *really* helps. I know I can let life happen and not be stressed that it is going to destroy anything long term.

While weighing myself today I was annoyed that I cannot sync my weight to my Garmin Connect app so [I bought a Garmin Index scale and blood pressure meter](../Fitness/Garmin%20Index%20scale%20and%20blood%20pressure.md) with my HSA money from former employer that is just sitting around on a card that will expire in about a year. This is good because I use [watts per kilogram over 3-second power](../Bikes/Watts%20per%20kilogram%20over%203-second%20power.md) now in my [essential Garmin computer stats](../Bikes/Essential%20Garmin%20computer%20stats.md).

I also have heard from several pros who matter-of-factly mentioned that W/kg is their primary indicator on their bike computers since that is the number that makes them competitive. It's also the number used everywhere within Zwift. Having that number as the main one (instead of 3 second power) at a glance motivates me in all the right ways and takes a lot of the guess work out because 3.1 W/kg is much easier to grok quickly. Using W/kg doesn't work at all without daily updates to weight that are [reliably consistent](../Fitness/Use%20realistic%20weight.md).

By the way, syncing weight to Zwift requires a FitBit account that will then sync to Zwift (which also works for Whithings scales). Apparently, the Whitings automatic sync was pulled because of repeated syncing issues (which I experienced and did not know about until just now).

And Garmin Connect syncs metrics to TrainingPeaks daily as well along with resting HR, HRV and such.

Just doing a little survey of people who placed in top three in my age group (55-64) and here are a couple that live in Asheville:

- [Paul Capua](https://www.strava.com/athletes/1835096) - 55, 2nd place, all-around obsessive rider, lawyer who travels world riding fun stuff
- [Randy Warren](https://www.strava.com/athletes/348160) - 62, 3rd place, life-long rider, nationals champion, full-time cycling coach and camp director

Both of these guys seem incredibly amazing, great role models. If, one day, I could even hold their wheel in one of these events I would consider that a huge success. I especially love that Randy is holding his own with people almost half his age. The 15 years depth of the 55-64 field means that as I age there will always be people who completely dominate. Guys this age are also my generation so they were raised on Greg Lemond and the rest so there are *a lot* of them. I am very proud to count myself among them but that simply means my chances at a GFNats podium are almost zero. Many of these guys are retired and effectively training at the pro level for their age group. I'm also doing that but have a very long way to go. Perhaps by the time I'm 60 I can shoot for a podium spot.

While on a dog walk I was telling Doris about Randy's life after stalking him for a while and was suddenly and very surprisingly overwhelmed with emotion. I was very verklempt. Why the fuck would I be so emotional after stalking Randy? When I was a Mormon I would say this "was the spirit confirming I need to take one of his camps and get to know him so I can grow up to be like him." It's good to have goals even if they seem completely trivial and even weird to the rest of the world.

Today's 2x20 threshold ride was really fun. I had to chuckle at how much my attitude about so many things has changed:
