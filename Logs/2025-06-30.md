Turns out the Goblin Route might be best for daily riding anyway. It's like a commute without a commute for a guy who works from home. In fact, if I do some amount of yoga in the morning before work and some amount of biking after work it perfectly simulates what I used to do physically when I bike commuted to Nike 20 miles each way. It also matches the morning yoga and afternoon paddle-boarding I used to do daily when I was single.

I enjoyed the new longer farmland routes but they are a bit more risky during bad weatherâ€”specifically afternoon thunderstorms in North Carolina. I can't bail and am very exposed to lightning strikes when out in the middle of farmland. So I've pretty much decided not to bike there during the thunderstorm season.

I could just bike in the morning and avoid the storms and hot temps. Perhaps some days I could still do that in place of yoga or switch the order around. But now that I'm streaming the traffic and monotony of the farmland routes doesn't make for very compelling live streaming content even though I got Starlink Mini so that I could.

One things for sure, I need to get into the habit of doing this every day again for lots of reasons:

- Better for my health since I don't move while working remotely from home
- Makes good use of the money I spend monthly on IRL livestreaming gear
-
