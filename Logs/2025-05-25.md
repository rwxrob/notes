I have no intention of getting crazy with my intensity now that I know it is a cause of arterial calcification in those who are older. [Too much intensity kills old people](../Fitness/Too%20much%20intensity%20kills%20old%20people.md). It was good for me to see that. I might land a podium but lose 10 years of my life. It's just not worth it. Also, it's not an excuse. It's science.

After cleaning out my bike shed and getting it looking really nice and rediscovering all the great gear I have I found myself drawn to adventure cycling again. A lot has changed since I abandoned it.

Perhaps the single biggest reason I'm thinking about it is because I don't fear traffic at all any more. I don't particularly like it but if I were to find a road that was both scenic and had traffic I would be fine now. I'd just put in my noise-reducing ear plugs and music like I do on my five-hour rides. With tubeless gravel tires on my Domane I could go anywhere I really wanted. Besides, I'm doing so much volume these days I might as well be connecting hotel or camping stays. It would be like a really slow stage race.

After finding this amazing [$60 AirBnB hostel in downtown Asheville](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/40274759?check_in=2025-05-25&check_out=2025-05-26&guests=1&adults=1&s=67&unique_share_id=41eeba70-5bd1-4f50-bd95-b28c921d0766) and [this route to Asheville that includes an abandonned highway that cars are no longer allowed to travel](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/50930024) and buying a [Tailfin aeropack](../Fitness/Best%20performance%20adventure%20cycling%20pack.md) my new way to do century rides on the weekend will be doing overnight trips to Asheville. I just have to get my "chores" done before I start spending the entire weekends on the road. The crazy thing is that all that changes is I don't return home doing a huge loop and just have a destination instead. After I do it the first time and know everything to expect and prepare for I'll start finding other like-minded people to invite. I'm sure I can find some [PAC](../Fitness/Performance%20adventure%20cycling%20FTW.md) people out there.

Now that I am realizing [performance adventure cycling](../Fitness/Performance%20adventure%20cycling%20FTW.md) is my main goal on the bike, the nagging worry about riding in a pack and peloton drafting skills and crashing because of someone else and breaking a hip in my 60s and not being focused enough on speed at these Gran Fondos has been completely cured. I no longer long for a podium or GFNats winner jersey or huge FTP numbers. In fact, I'm back to being really happy I signed up for NC Mountains to Coast this year because I am going to do the entire thing as if I were doing it self-supported carrying my own gear the whole way. Then in coming years I will do my own trips for much less money and meet my wife at the end or just have her meet me and stay overnight in each of the towns and drive in the car to the next one while I just bike to it. I think I would look forward to these ultra-endurance trips more than any competitive Gran Fondo but we will see. The $160 price tag just to enter a Gran Fondo would pay for a very nice hotel anywhere 300 miles away from my home.

This has changed my approach to everything this year. The 24 Hours of Booty is something I will actually ride to on my bike and do without a car at all. I'll just take my bike into the sleeping area and crash when I need to sleep and use a bivy and inflatable pad and mosquito net over my face. I'll eat whatever I can find. I'm going to dial in my ultralight, minimal setup that I would use to do Bike Nonstop US if and when I do.

Watched *Inspired to Ride* with Mike Hall and Juliana Buhring in 2015 doing one of the first TransAm Races—a movie which inspired Lael Wilcox to later beat both of their times and take the world record for around the world trip. 

The biggest conclusion from the movie is how life-threateningly dangerous adventure cycling on any roads with traffic is and how absolutely stupid you have to be to ride the classic TransAm route. Mike Hall would later have the fastest Tour Divide time. Then he'd be splatted on the windshield of a fucking moron blowing through a red light at 60 mph in 2017 in Australia while Mike was simply waiting for the light. In the movie, more than half didn't finish, one was hit by a car and destroyed his bike needing to get a new one, and at least one of the bike tourers, Julianna Abernathy, on the same journey would be killed in a hit-and-run while riding to "remember Martin Luther King." Later in 2017, 61-year-old Eric Fishbein of San Luis Obispo, California, was struck from behind by a vehicle while riding on K-96 near Leoti, Kansas. He died at the scene. There are countless others who have silently died on American roads while adventure cycling. Adventure Cycling Association has started pushing many routes instead of the class TransAm because of it.

The Bike Nonstop US director actually has this to say:

>**Can riders still ride the classic "Trans Am Bike Race"?** Yes, but we ask all riders to consider why the event director has changed the format before doggedly pursuing a race on roads that are heavily trafficked. This is a very personal plea from myself, the event creator and director, Nathan Jones asking you to consider embracing this new format. I understand respecting tradition and wanting to pursue the same routes as our heroes. That said, I have to formally ask for respect as the director of this event. I am asking you to really take to heart these changes and embrace something new. I understand fully what the classic Trans Am Bike Race means to people, but I often feel like many people never understand my perspective on all of this. While I do not fault anyone for their perception of this event, I am insistent upon everyone challenging their perspective. For my mental health, I thank you for understanding.

When the event organizer *begs* people not to ride the classic route and people are still doing so and getting killed *every year* you have to wonder if it is even worth doing. The original TransAm route was created in the 70s when these roads had far less traffic traveling at maybe 60 mph maximum. Now the speed limits are in the 80s. The numbers do not lie, statistically, anyone riding the TransAm classic has a 1 in 60 chance of simply dying because of it, a 1 in 30 chance of not finishing, and
