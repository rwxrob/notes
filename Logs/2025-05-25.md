I have no intention of getting crazy with my intensity now that I know it is a cause of arterial calcification in those who are older. [Too much intensity kills old people](../Fitness/Too%20much%20intensity%20kills%20old%20people.md). It was good for me to see that. I might land a podium but lose 10 years of my life. It's just not worth it. Also, it's not an excuse. It's science.

After cleaning out my bike shed and getting it looking really nice and rediscovering all the great gear I have I found myself drawn to adventure cycling again. A lot has changed since I abandoned it.

Perhaps the single biggest reason I'm thinking about it is because I don't fear traffic at all any more. I don't particularly like it but if I were to find a road that was both scenic and had traffic I would be fine now. I'd just put in my noise-reducing ear plugs and music like I do on my five-hour rides. With tubeless gravel tires on my Domane I could go anywhere I really wanted. Besides, I'm doing so much volume these days I might as well be connecting hotel or camping stays. It would be like a really slow stage race.
