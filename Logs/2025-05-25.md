I have no intention of getting crazy with my intensity now that I know it is a cause of arterial calcification in those who are older. [Too much intensity kills old people](../Fitness/Too%20much%20intensity%20kills%20old%20people.md). It was good for me to see that. I might land a podium but lose 10 years of my life. It's just not worth it. Also, it's not an excuse. It's science.
