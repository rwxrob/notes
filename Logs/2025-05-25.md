I have no intention of getting crazy with my intensity now that I know it is a cause of arterial calcification in those who are older. [Too much intensity kills old people](../Fitness/Too%20much%20intensity%20kills%20old%20people.md). It was good for me to see that. I might land a podium but lose 10 years of my life. It's just not worth it. Also, it's not an excuse. It's science.

After cleaning out my bike shed and getting it looking really nice and rediscovering all the great gear I have I found myself drawn to adventure cycling again. A lot has changed since I abandoned it.

Perhaps the single biggest reason I'm thinking about it is because I don't fear traffic at all any more. I don't particularly like it but if I were to find a road that was both scenic and had traffic I would be fine now. I'd just put in my noise-reducing ear plugs and music like I do on my five-hour rides. With tubeless gravel tires on my Domane I could go anywhere I really wanted. Besides, I'm doing so much volume these days I might as well be connecting hotel or camping stays. It would be like a really slow stage race.

I just cannot do [1-week protein fast](../Fitness/1-week%20protein%20fast.md). I absolutely hate it. I'll just add more miles of low-intensity volume and keep running a slight deficit instead. In fact, I'm going to work up to double centuries on the weekends.

After finding this amazing [$60 AirBnB hostel in downtown Asheville](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/40274759?check_in=2025-05-25&check_out=2025-05-26&guests=1&adults=1&s=67&unique_share_id=41eeba70-5bd1-4f50-bd95-b28c921d0766) and [this route to Asheville that includes an abandonned highway that cars are no longer allowed to travel](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/50930024) and buying a [Tailfin aeropack](../Fitness/Best%20performance%20adventure%20cycling%20pack.md) my new way to do century rides on the weekend will be doing overnight trips to Asheville. I just have to get my "chores" done before I start spending the entire weekends on the road. The crazy thing is that all that changes is I don't return home doing a huge loop and just have a destination instead. After I do it the first time and know everything to expect and prepare for I'll start finding other like-minded people to invite. I'm sure I can find some [PAC](../Fitness/Performance%20adventure%20cycling%20FTW.md) people out there.

Now that I am realizing [performance adventure cycling](../Fitness/Performance%20adventure%20cycling%20FTW.md) is my main goal on the bike, the nagging worry about riding in a pack and peloton drafting skills and crashing because of someone else and breaking a hip in my 60s and not being focused enough on speed a these Gran Fondos has been completely cured. I no longer long for a podium or GFNats winner jersey or huge FTP numbers. In fact, I'm back to being really happy I signed up for NC Mountains to Coast this year because I am going to do the entire thing as if I were doing it self-supported carrying my own gear the whole way. Then in coming years I will do my own trips for much less money and meet my wife at the end or just have her meet me and stay overnight in each of the towns and drive in the car to the next one while I just bike to it.

This has changed my approach to everything this year. The 24 Hours of Booty is something I will actually ride to on my bike and do without a car at all. I'll just take my bike into the sleeping area and crash when I need to sleep and use a bivy and inflatable pad.
