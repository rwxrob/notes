I have no intention of getting crazy with my intensity now that I know it is a cause of arterial calcification in those who are older. [Too much intensity kills old people](../Fitness/Too%20much%20intensity%20kills%20old%20people.md). It was good for me to see that. I might land a podium but lose 10 years of my life. It's just not worth it. Also, it's not an excuse. It's science.

After cleaning out my bike shed and getting it looking really nice and rediscovering all the great gear I have I found myself drawn to adventure cycling again. A lot has changed since I abandoned it.

Perhaps the single biggest reason I'm thinking about it is because I don't fear traffic at all any more. I don't particularly like it but if I were to find a road that was both scenic and had traffic I would be fine now. I'd just put in my noise-reducing ear plugs and music like I do on my five-hour rides. With tubeless gravel tires on my Domane I could go anywhere I really wanted. Besides, I'm doing so much volume these days I might as well be connecting hotel or camping stays. It would be like a really slow stage race.

After finding this amazing [$60 AirBnB hostel in downtown Asheville](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/40274759?check_in=2025-05-25&check_out=2025-05-26&guests=1&adults=1&s=67&unique_share_id=41eeba70-5bd1-4f50-bd95-b28c921d0766) and [this route to Asheville that includes an abandonned highway that cars are no longer allowed to travel](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/50930024) and buying a [Tailfin aeropack](../Fitness/Best%20performance%20adventure%20cycling%20pack.md) my new way to do century rides on the weekend will be doing overnight trips to Asheville. I just have to get my "chores" done before I start spending the entire weekends on the road. The crazy thing is that all that changes is I don't return home doing a huge loop and just have a destination instead. After I do it the first time and know everything to expect and prepare for I'll start finding other like-minded people to invite. I'm sure I can find some [PAC](../Fitness/Performance%20adventure%20cycling%20FTW.md) people out there.

Now that I am realizing [performance adventure cycling](../Fitness/Performance%20adventure%20cycling%20FTW.md) is my main goal on the bike, the nagging worry about riding in a pack and peloton drafting skills and crashing because of someone else and breaking a hip in my 60s and not being focused enough on speed at these Gran Fondos has been completely cured. I no longer long for a podium or GFNats winner jersey or huge FTP numbers. In fact, I'm back to being really happy I signed up for NC Mountains to Coast this year because I am going to do the entire thing as if I were doing it self-supported carrying my own gear the whole way. Then in coming years I will do my own trips for much less money and meet my wife at the end or just have her meet me and stay overnight in each of the towns and drive in the car to the next one while I just bike to it. I think I would look forward to these ultra-endurance trips more than any competitive Gran Fondo but we will see. The $160 price tag just to enter a Gran Fondo would pay for a very nice hotel anywhere 300 miles away from my home.

This has changed my approach to everything this year. The 24 Hours of Booty is something I will actually ride to on my bike and do without a car at all. I'll just take my bike into the sleeping area and crash when I need to sleep and use a bivy and inflatable pad and mosquito net over my face. I'll eat whatever I can find. I'm going to dial in my ultralight, minimal setup that I would use to do Bike Nonstop US if and when I do.

Watched Inspired to Ride and all I can say is you'd have to be a fucking moron with a death wish to ride the [TramsAm classic route](../Fitness/Morons%20choose%20TramsAm%20classic%20route.md) in 2025 or later. Things have only gotten severely worse since 2015. I'm really glad I watched it because I've been getting a little desensitized to the danger of riding with traffic since I've started putting in four hours a day. While I do think [performance adventure cycling](../Fitness/Performance%20adventure%20cycling%20FTW.md) is worth another look, it is definitely can be abused to the point where it's not healthy at all and actually takes away from long-term performance.
