Yesterday while biking my new Goblin route and stopping into OTPH (my favorite home pub) I realized that riding without clips made the entire thing more fun and comfortable and allowed me to do stuff that I could not do with racing shoes, like take really sharp turns with my foot off the pedal in case I start to slide out. I realized that my favorite type of riding is fast flowy MTB trails or urban "bike messenger" style riding (without as much irresponsible blowing of traffic lights with crosswalks full of people). In fact, I totally ride any gravel with my Domane now that I realized that my road pedals are actually just fine with stiff flats.
