Yesterday on my 130k ride I realized a lot about my [GFNats training strategy](../Outdoor%20sports/GFNats%20training%20strategy.md) and why I absolutely love it so much. The official events are 4-timed-segment-climbs connected with long, social, fun recovery rides promoting training that perfectly aligns with how I just enjoy riding my bike every day. Winning is based *mostly* on 10-minute power, durability, high training volume, and purposeful recoveryâ€”not insanely high FTP numbers. In fact, it is more important to train to be comfortable and fully recovered over long hours than it is to ever burst out the power. That's right, no crazy intervals of suffering and painful torture in the gym. This also means that group rides are almost always detracting from training progress for the GFNat events so no more guilt about hating group rides. Rather than working on staying fast and aero and picking the perfect line and ignoring the assholes on the group ride it is way more important to get really good staying comfortable and happy over very long rides and climbing hard solo when the time comes, like bike touring but faster and with a competitive aspect.
