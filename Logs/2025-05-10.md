Reminded that I don't have much cartilage left in my knees. I get reminded why I cannot run or even to long hikes very well because of it. You'd think that makes me sad but really it doesn't. I used them out doing a ton of amazing things throughout my whole life. I'm only 57 so that says a lot. Swimming and cycling and paddle boarding and yoga are all options for a long time.
