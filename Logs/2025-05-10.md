Reminded that I don't have much cartilage left in my knees. I get reminded why I cannot run or even to long hikes very well because of it. You'd think that makes me sad but really it doesn't. I used them out doing a ton of amazing things throughout my whole life. I'm only 57 so that says a lot. Swimming and cycling and paddle boarding and yoga are all options for a long time.

I've changed my annual plan and daily routine to be more focused on body prep for 2026 competitive training. Most significantly, I'm going to get back to 5-hour 70% daily rides as soon as possible. I want to simulate a perpetual adventure bike tour this year and get the point where 5 hours in the saddle is absolutely normal. Then, when I add intensity later in 2026 the 5 hour duration will still feel normal, just harder. All the Gran Fondos will feel easy at that point.
