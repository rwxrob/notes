Still healing from scabs but they are manageable. Legs surprisingly fresh for doing another weight session just yesterday. I think three a week for a while with nothing else on that day is going to be really good.

Planning 180k or so today all in Z1-Z2 with no watt bombs but not married to distance, 170 TSS or so. It's rather cold out for a long slow ride so wearing most of winter kit. I really wish I had a good, tight, wind-breaking gilet to stuff in a pocket. I'm really not a fan of the long-sleeve gorewear unless there is a strong chance of even light rain and no sun. To hard to control ventilation.

- Ornot thermal lined winter tights (PERFECT pick!)
- ~~Winter socks~~ Neopro compression socks
- Road shoes with toe covers
- Arm warmers (took off hour 3.5)
- Merino wool tee-shirt base layer (way too hot at hour 3 and couldn't take off, wicking undershirt + gilet vest next time)
- Merino wool neck gator (took off hour 1:40)
- Neopro ~~Nyx~~  Haze jersey (most visible)
- Regular photochromatic transitions Raybans (giving the Rudy's with inserts a rest)
- MAAP winter cap with ear covers (took off hour 4)
- SUUNTO bone-conducting headphones (only used half the time)
- ~~Earplugs~~ (forgot them)
- S~~howers Pass Crosspoint waterproof gloves (just carrying in case, need to find lighter weight gloves)~~ (too warm)
