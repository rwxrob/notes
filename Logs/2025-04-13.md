Still healing from scabs but they are manageable. Legs surprisingly fresh for doing another weight session just yesterday. I think three a week for a while with nothing else on that day is going to be really good.

Planning 180k or so today all in Z1-Z2 with no watt bombs but not married to distance, 170 TSS or so. It's rather cold out for a long slow ride so wearing most of winter kit. I really wish I had a good, tight, wind-breaking gilet. I'm really not a fan of the long-sleeve gorewear unless there is a strong chance of even light rain and no sun. To hard to control ventilation.

- Ornot thermal lined winter tights
- Winter socks
- Road shoes with toe covers
- Arm warmers
- Merino wool tee-shirt base layer
- Neopro Nyx jersey
- Regular photochromatic transitions Raybans (giving the Rudy's with inserts a rest)
