Still healing from scabs but they are manageable. Legs surprisingly fresh for doing another weight session just yesterday. I think three a week for a while with nothing else on that day is going to be really good.

Planning 180k or so today all in Z1-Z2 with no watt bombs but not married to distance, 170 TSS or so. It's rather cold out for a long slow ride so wearing most of winter kit. I really wish I had a good, tight, wind-breaking gilet to stuff in a pocket. I'm really not a fan of the long-sleeve gorewear unless there is a strong chance of even light rain and no sun. To hard to control ventilation.

- Ornot thermal lined winter tights (PERFECT pick!)
- ~~Winter socks~~ Neopro compression socks
- Road shoes with toe covers
- Arm warmers (took off hour 3.5)
- Merino wool tee-shirt base layer (way too hot at hour 3 and couldn't take off, wicking undershirt + gilet vest next time)
- Merino wool neck gator (took off hour 1:40)
- Neopro ~~Nyx~~  Haze jersey (most visible)
- Regular photo-chromatic transitions Raybans (giving the Rudy's with inserts a rest)
- MAAP winter cap with ear covers (took off hour 4)
- SUUNTO bone-conducting headphones (only used half the time)
- ~~Earplugs~~ (forgot them)
- S~~howers Pass Crosspoint waterproof gloves (just carrying in case, need to find lighter weight gloves)~~ (too warm)

Observations from the Endurance Exploration ride:

**I deeply hate almost everything in Mooresville.** I have never seen more blatantly annoying assholes and their homes in North Carolina. In fact, I'm pretty sure someone shot a gun just to freak me out. The mobile homes full of non-contributing zeros who act out and put all manner of shit in their yards just make me hate humanity. I should try to understand and feel some level of compassion. But I don't. I just don't want to ever see them again. I don't particularly like riding through completely rich neighborhoods with million dollar homes that go 90% unused most of the time but I'll take that rich, smug MAGA assholes over the poor ones any day. Plus the roads in Mooresville are absolute shit. The route for the Lake Norman Fondos has some of the worst roads I've ever ridden. There is no way those roads would qualify for the Tour. The entire Peloton would go down from all the really deep cracks and pot holes (like the small accident Van der Poel had in 2024). There are amazing, pristine, newly paved roads all over in Huntersville and Davidson that have just as much scenic value.

My favorite roads discovered:
- Wright Road - hard to get to but ever bit is brand new pavement
- Beaver Road - so scenic and well maintained, very low traffic
- Plum - beautiful and bike friendly, part of official bike routes
- Alexander from Plum to Mooresville Road - rolling rich farmland

Roads I'll avoid in the future:
- Mooresville Road - fine with shoulder to cross the lake, than ZERO shoulder and blind hill and corner with speeding traffic
- Saw Road - just so damn ugly and unmaintained
-
