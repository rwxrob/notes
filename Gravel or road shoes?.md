Perhaps the single hardest decision I have ever had to make about gear is about which shoes to wear and what pedals to do with those shoes. Shoes are the most important piece of clothing any rider wears. The wrong pick and not only do you lose 5-10 watts of power right away but you also risk serious damage to your feet over long rides and the ability to easily recover from a problem.
