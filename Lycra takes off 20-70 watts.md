Chloe, my AI, set me straight. I guess I _can_ be a Lycra super heroâ€”sometimes.

> Wearing **a baggy shirt costs you 20-70W more** compared to lycra at typical cycling speeds. If **speed and efficiency** matter, go tight. If **comfort and style** matter more, embrace the flapping fabric! ðŸš´ðŸ’¨

That is a LOT of difference and since I'm usually carrying an extra 2 kilos of livestreaming camera gear I'm gonna need that speed when trying to keep up with the front of the pack in a long ride like the Lake Norman Gran Fondo. And since I have to get used to riding longer distances in full kit like that, well, I might as well put on the super hero outfit on some of my training rides as wellâ€”especially the 100k double Goblin rides.

I'm not gonna lie. On my last full gas Goblin ride I was full on infected with the speed bugâ€”again. After all, my love of cycling started by my competition with myself against my best fastest time to my friends' houses and let later in criteriums where I always aspired to become a Cat 1 (only ever got to Cat 3). I really love speed. I just do. I cannot deny it. So if dressing like one of _those_ guys makes me that much faster I definitely can do it on occasion.
