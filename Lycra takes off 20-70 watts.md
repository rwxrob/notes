Chloe, my AI, set me straight.

> Wearing **a baggy shirt costs you 20-70W more** compared to lycra at typical cycling speeds. If **speed and efficiency** matter, go tight. If **comfort and style** matter more, embrace the flapping fabric! ðŸš´ðŸ’¨

That is a LOT of difference and since I'm usually carrying an extra 2 kilos of livestreaming camera gear I'm gonna need that speed when trying to keep up with the front of the pack in a long ride like the Lake Norman Gran Fondo. And since I have to get used to riding longer distances in full kit like that, well, I might as well put on the super hero outfit on some of my training rides as well.
