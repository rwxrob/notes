Eventually, I'm going to get the best all-around wheel-set money can buy. These wheels will cost much more than the road bike I currently have but they will hold up in value when I upgrade my road bike the year after.

With these wheels I can put them on when the weather is perfect and I really want to go fast on tarmac with no gravel around. I can swap in my winter wheels with 38c tires and tubes that can be easily repaired when conditions are questionable.

- Continental Grand Prix 5000 S TR 28c

I'm rewarding myself with these as soon my cycling fitness goals. That way I have something to work for, sort of like Zwift for real.
