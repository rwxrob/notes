I'll have to wait until 2026 after I have a new bonus (and weight 10 kilos less).  Eventually, I'm going to get the best all-arounder wheel-set money can buy. These wheels will cost much more than the road bike I currently have but they will hold up in value when I upgrade my road bike the year after. That way I can swap in my winter wheels with 38c tires and tubes that can be easily repaired when conditions are questionable.
