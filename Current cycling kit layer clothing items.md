Here's my preferred cycling kit for my all-road/gravel style, head to toe. The only time I want to be a lycra super hero is going for Strava KOM hunting.

## Head

Getting headwear right is crucial. Temperature regulation really works through the scalp and mine is bald. Too hot of a head and everything else sweats through. Too cold and my hands and feet freeze, which reminds me of the old "if you want warm feet put on a hat adage from skiing days."

- VIictgoal waterproof helmet cover (fits over cap brim as well)
- Giro Aries Spherical Helmet
- MAAP Evade 5 Panel Cap (under helmet, warmer)
- Tillak Wallowa Trail Mesh 5 Panel Cap (under helmet, cooler)
- Trimmed neck gator over ears
- Anbow silicon ear plugs trimmed to not stick out
- Finestic disposable face mask(s)
- Bandanna and/or neck gator
- Prescription glasses with anti-glare and photo-chromatic lenses (AmericasBest)

I have found that combining a good 5-panel hat under a good, general road helmet is always the best for my style of riding (and Dustin Klein agrees). It shields the run and foliage way better than a dedicated MTB helmet, others a layer of moisture wicking and comfort, and looks completely normal when I remove the helmet and leave it with the bike while I grab a coffee or whatever. MAAP makes the Evade, an absolutely perfect version of this cap designed for this purpose but I mix them up for variety and just wear one of DKLEIN's SCRAM or other caps as well under if I know I'm going to be walking around a lot without a helmet.

I once tried a full-face helmet for MTB riding, but that was a waste. I just changed my style of riding to be fine with my "gravel" helmet setup.

The waterproof helmet cover is a super simple and light solution to torrential thunderstorm downpours. It keeps the sometimes cotton hat from completely soaking through and making it impossible to see because of all the water dripping in my eyes.
## Torso

- Gorewear Spinshift Gortex Men's Jacket (M)
- Gorewear Fernflow hooded windbreaker (M)
- Patagonia Nano-Air puffy jacket (not hoody)
- Merino.tech merino wool t-shirt
- Basic light arm warmers
- NeoPro or YKYWBIKE sleeveless quick-dry undershirt
- Garmin heart rate monitor
- USWE Outlander Pro 2 pack with NDM 1 Action Camera harness

The pack with the camera gear in provides a lot of core warmth since it covers most of my chest and upper back. I can usually get away with a t-shirt under it with arm warmers or just a synthetic flannel gravel shirt. For information on the livestreaming kit see other notes.
## Hands

- Bar Mitts handlebar mittens
- Showers Pass Cross Point waterproof knit wool touchscreen gloves
