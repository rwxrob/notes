While I'm still deciding how competitive to get for 2026 I do know that I pretty much need to ride 80k (50 miles) a day to maintain base health and fitness since I have a remote day job working literally from my bedroom (where I also have a desk). Riding that length in zone 2 takes about three hours. That pace is exactly what I was training for to cross the country by bike, which I still haven't ruled out doing at some point. If I up the intensity for some intervals and mix in recovery it may take slightly less time during build days.
