>As a Senior HPC ML Systems Developer Engineer, I want to build a home lab so that I can test and practice deploying and administering multiple Kubernetes clusters and a PBC deployment specializing in ML job submission as well as microservices managed though GitOps CI/CD.

1. Get a high-speed Internet connection
2. Identify a location at home with enough power to cooling to place hardware
3. Acquire a main server on which to install Proxmox and host virtual machines
4. Optionally acquire additional bare-metal machines (perhaps to enable GPU testing)
5. [[Design the architecture of your home lab]]

7. [Bootstrap Kubernetes cluster with Kubespray and Ansible](Bootstrap%20Kubernetes%20cluster%20with%20Kubespray%20and%20Ansible.md)
