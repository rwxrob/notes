After a few years of cycling while livestreaming I've concluded my bike riding falls into one of the following categories:

| Percentage | Stream | Type                             | Example                                    |
| ---------- | ------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 92%        | 100%   | Safe suburban streets and trails | Goblin Tour/Road                           |
| 23%        | 100%   | MTB XC+ flowy trails             | Mazeppa, Jetton, Fisher, Mountain Creek    |
| 14%        | 70%    | Indoor Zwift training/racing     | Tour du Zwift, Z Racing                    |
| 4%         | 50%    | Paid supported group rides       | Mountains to Coast, Western Spirit Cycling |

I've always been an off-road, flowy I'm my heart I'm a really a lonely roads endurance rider when I'm outside even though I really love the gravel culture in general. If I'm honest, I'll take tarmac over gravel or dirt any day. I've had my fill of bing jarred to death by mountain biking over the years.
