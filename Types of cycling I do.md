After a few years of cycling while livestreaming and some while not I've concluded all of my cycling going forward falls into one of the following categories:

| Percentage | Stream | Type                       | Example            |
| ---------- | ------ | -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 2%         | 80%    | Paid supported group rides | Mountains to Coast |
* Supported group rides
* Indoor Zwift training and competition
