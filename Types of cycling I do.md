After a few years of cycling while livestreaming and some not I've concluded all of my cycling going forward falls into one of the following categories:

| Percentage | Stream | Type                         | Example                       |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 80%        | 100%   | Suburban safe streets/trails | Goblin Tour                   |
|            | 80%    | Indoor Zwift training/racing | Tour du Zwift, Z Racing       |
| 2%         | 80%    | Paid supported group rides   | Mountains to Coast, White Rim |
