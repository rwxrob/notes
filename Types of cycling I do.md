After a few years of cycling while livestreaming I've concluded my bike riding falls into one of the following categories:

| Percentage | Stream | Type                             | Example                                    |
| ---------- | ------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 92%        | 100%   | Safe suburban streets and trails | Goblin Tour/Road                           |
| 23%        | 100%   | MTB XC+ flowy trails             | Mazeppa, Jetton, Fisher, Mountain Creek    |
| 14%        | 70%    | Indoor Zwift training/racing     | Tour du Zwift, Z Racing                    |
| 4%         | 50%    | Paid supported group rides       | Mountains to Coast, Western Spirit Cycling |

I've always been an off-road, pump-n-flow XC bike rider at heart, one who enjoys the interval training of going up hill for a solid 10 minutes or so, and then just enjoying the payment for going up. I don't really consider myself a gravity rider because I really love long, flat scenic trails as well. 

I also love riding fast on and relatively  safe, scenic roads, light gravel, poorly maintained tarmac, or suburban streets. I suppose this falls under "endurance riding" or "all road." I don't consider this "gravel" riding because gravel has become XC MTB with road handlebars at this point. Unbound looks absolutely stupid to me. That type of riding has all the suffering of both road and mountain biking with none of the joy, unless your joy comes from packing your bike over your shoulder through a mile of completely unnecessary mud. I've also never been attracted to cyclocross. Those things are for people who think forced discomfort is actually fun to "push their limits" and I learned in my 30s that, well, that's just fucking stupid. Pushing physical limits is one thing, pushing metal limits you've voluntarily created for yourself by way of mud, rain, cold, or 

Then again, I absolutely love swerving in and out of traffic on occasion like fixie riders. While I still don't have one, I could really get into it. The main reason I don't is because as fun as it is I really do not have a death wish. Urban "messenger bike" riders die about every month in New York. Even if I survived, ever major accident or altercation with a vehicle has happened while "sharing the road" with cars.

when I'm outside even though I really love the gravel culture in general. If I'm honest, I'll take tarmac over gravel or dirt any day. I've had my fill of bing jarred to death by mountain biking over the years.
