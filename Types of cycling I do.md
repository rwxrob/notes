After a few years of cycling while livestreaming I've concluded my bike riding falls into one of the following categories:

| Percentage | Stream | Type                             | Example                                    |
| ---------- | ------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 92%        | 100%   | Safe suburban streets and trails | Goblin Tour/Road                           |
| 23%        | 100%   | MTB XC+ flowy trails             | Mazeppa, Jetton, Fisher, Mountain Creek    |
| 14%        | 70%    | Indoor Zwift training/racing     | Tour du Zwift, Z Racing                    |
| 4%         | 50%    | Paid supported group rides       | Mountains to Coast, Western Spirit Cycling |

I've always been an off-road, pump-n-flow XC bike rider at heart, one who enjoys the interval training of going up hill for a solid 10 minutes or so, and then just enjoying the payment for going up. I don't really consider myself a gravity rider because I really love long, flat scenic trails as well. 

I also love riding fast on and relatively  safe, scenic roads, light gravel, poorly maintained tarmac, or suburban streets. I suppose this falls under "endurance riding" or "all road."

Then again, I absolutely love swerving in and out of traffic on occasion like fixie riders. While I still don't have one, I could really get into it. The main reason I don't is because as fun as it is I really do not have a death wish. Urban "messenger bike" riders die about every month in New York. Even if I survived, ever major accident or altercation with a 

when I'm outside even though I really love the gravel culture in general. If I'm honest, I'll take tarmac over gravel or dirt any day. I've had my fill of bing jarred to death by mountain biking over the years.
