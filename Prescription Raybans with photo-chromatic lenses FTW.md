Look, I know they don't look nearly as cool as my Rudy spin shades. They are also probably less aero and heavier. So what. Photo-chromatic lenses that adapt to being on a shady road versus a sunny one are completely worth it. 

The whole point of the cycling obsession is amazing scenery!

Sure they have them for expensive cycling things but they always require a "prescription insert" that never lines up correctly with my prescription. And no, tri-focals aren't even an option so good luck seeing your bike computer no matter what that font. So yeah, I'll be the guy in the so-nerdy-their-hip retro Raybans with the think lenses on the podium at Gran Fondo nationals at #1 for my age group, so help me god. Then *we shall see*. Who knows maybe I'll even start a new trend (or break the old one).
