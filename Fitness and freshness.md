I really love fitness and freshness on Strava. I have to sub to get it but it is worth it. It really gamifies fitness in a nice way that anyone can appreciateâ€”especially non-pros and people just too lazy to do the math every day to figure it all out. Just keep the graphs looking good and keep them improving to win the game. Here are a few observations I've made because of it.

- Two points per day is good and sustainable without a lot of time off
- Last I was over 100 fitness was May 2023
- Will put me back over 100 fitness mid March 2025
- Goblin All-Road 50k in zone 2 (2:20 at 22.5 kph) is perfect (despite the many hills)
- 127 TSS, right at the top of what can be recovered in under 24 hours
