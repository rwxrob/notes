Racing in Tour Divide and other "self-supported" ultra-cycling events is a joke. As much as I appreciate athletes like Lachlan Mornton and his "fastest unofficial time" for Tour Divide it was a complete publicity stunt that he did for free from his sponsors with a full support team that even arranged all his lodging. He never claimed to be following "the rules" but, honestly, the rules are a complete scam.

The appeal of Tour Divide and things like it has lost all appeal for me at this point:

* The Tour Divide "organizers" have never had even the slightest clue what they are doing
* Everyone breaks the rules but rules are applied unfairly 
* The "race" isn't a race at all
* The route changes every year so there is no comparing (even though many do)
* Weather is far too volatile to pit your PR against previous attempts
* Fastpacking through pristine

Everyone would get more out of this from bikepacking against a personal best as opposed to this bullshit. It's really sad because people spend their lives dedicated to setting "records" but one person gets disqualified while others do not. It is just not worth it. Find another way to push your limits that is actually regulated or self-regulate instead.
