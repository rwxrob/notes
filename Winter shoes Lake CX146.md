I haven't tried them yet but my goal is to ride through the next winter even in the light rain and to get geared up over the coming months for it gradually. A core piece of kit will be shoes that take the hassle out of shoe covers. 
These Lake's look like my favorite so far.

Need to remember to size up, probably 43 for me, oh, and to get wide. Don't want any compression at all with Winter riding which is a lot less about the watts and more about just getting out.
